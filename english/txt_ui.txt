- This game is likely to forever remain an experimental work-in-progress and to never reach the quality, proper stability and optimization of a finished product.

#dsclmr_3
- Playing solo is available, but the main focus of this game is multiplayer.

#joingame_persist
Persistent games

#joingame_persist_dscr_1
Persistant games are the main game mode to experience Ymir: slow paced games that can last for months on servers that run 24/7.

#joingame_persist_dscr_2
To garantee a reliable and fair experience for all players, servers listed here all share the same strict standardized official "persistent mode" settings. Server customization is not allowed: there are no mods, no server-specific rules and the server hosts are powerless (no admin tools to ban or moderate players). Only gameplay is law.

#joingame_realtime
Real-time games

#joingame_realtime_dscr_1
Realtime games are an official game mode of Ymir for faster paced games that are meant to be played in multiple sessions with friends or smaller groups of players.

#joingame_custom
Custom games

#joingame_custom_dscr_1
Custom games are community hosted games with no enforced standardization, where server customization is allowed. The intended game balance might therefore be affected and the reliability of your game experience cannot be garanteed in these servers.

#joingame_custom_dscr_2
WARNING: Please note that unlike official game mode servers, there might be server-specific rules and server moderation tools are unlocked to the server hosts. That includes the power to ban players from their servers at their sole discretion.
