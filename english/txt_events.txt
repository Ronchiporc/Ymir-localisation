#ch_palentir1_1#1
It was on a quiet moonless night, at a time when all piglets had long been asleep. The sky was clear, and the people rested under the discreet lustre of the stars when a small shimmering light suddenly appeared over the horizon, yet brighter than any full moon. Those who were awake at that moment looked in disbelief and watched as it moved slowly across their sky. 

#ch_palentir1_2#1
For minutes, people just stood there watching quietly, mesmerized and undecided of how to react to such an event. As the light progressed, the surrounding sky started to light up in dancing green shades. The lights were beautiful, swaying and changing and illuminating the city. How could something so beautiful be a bad omen? Surely this was foreshadowing something good. 

#ch_palentir1_3#1
Suddenly, as it reached the zenith, the light silently exploded in 7 distinct fireballs as the growing watching populace gasped in surprise and wonder. The 7 fragments, each followed by a golden scintillating trail, scattered in different direction drawing glittering lines falling back towards the horizon on all sides. There, they disappeared without a sound. Soon, the night was as quiet and dark as it was a few minutes ago. 

#ch_palentir2_1#1
Rumors are spreading about mysterious artefacts fallen from the sky and surrounded by a powerful aura. Many travellers from various regions are telling stories of curious people who went to investigate places where fire was seen falling from the skies. While many who went there are never seen back again, others speak of unknown dangers and rocks coming alive. People living nearby say they can see light glowing in the middle of the nights. 

#ch_palentir2_2#1
One particular story claims someone managed to see one: a glowing dark stone one can hardly detach his sight of, shining of indescribable colours and deeper than an ocean, brewing with moving storm clouds. It was resting in the middle of the crater surrounded by creatures of stone like none has ever seen, and the whole area around it felt charged of a powerful energy. But maybe more interestingly, the stone looked broken: while one face was perfectly smooth and curved like the surface of a globe, the other sides were as sharp as a broken shard of obsidian stone. It looked as if it was only a fragment of what was originally a much bigger stone in the shape of a perfect globe.

#ch_palentir2_3#1
Will anyone manage to find if these stories hold any truth? Soothsayers are already spreading prophecies and tells about these stone fragments, saying they are of great significance and that whoever manages to gather them all will have great power bestowed upon himself beyond his dreams.

#ch_palentir3_1#1
News are spreading that [x] of the [y] has managed to gather the 7 Palentir fragments and that he has successfully reassembled the Palentir stone in his capital city! 

#ch_palentir3_2#1
No one knows what will happen now and what usage will be made of this great power if the prophecies predicting it have been right.

#ch_palentir4_1#1
New rumors are spreading that the owner of the Palentir stone has made use of it and wished for nothing else but the prosperity, happiness, and advancement for all people of the [y].

#ch_palentir4_2#1
It is said that in response, the stone gave [x] knowledges from the Gods to fulfil this wish. According to some witnesses, engineers and builders of the city have already been given instructions and mysterious plans to build monumental artefacts that are speculated to yield magical benefits to all inhabitants.

#ch_palentir5_1#1
The people of [y] have finally completed building a first mysterious black monolith based on the unexplainable knowledges given by the power of the Palentir. Following the event, visitors witnessed that the people of the city seemed to behave differently within days: the most aggressive and violent Porcos now appeared well-behaved and law-abiding, the mood in the whole city seemed to have inexplicably improved, and porcos once dumb as a rock were now seen discussing philosophical ideas with their neighbors. All violences and discontent was reportedly reduced. It was as if the whole population had suddenly achieved a higher degree of wisdom and refinement, shedding off a layer of their barbaric ways. 

#ch_palentir5_2#1
Rumors have it that many new black monoliths are already planned for construction. If each one brings as many benefits as that first one, it won't be long before the people of the [y] evolve to something far above the level of other peoples, thus achieving undisputable glory beyond the reach of any of us.

#ch_palentir6_1#1
Terrible rumors are spreading from the [y]. It is said that [x], owner of the Palentir, has made use of it with sinister intent, wishing to become nothing else but the only ruler of this world. 

#ch_palentir7_1#1
Something terrible happened in the capital city of the [y], as the construction of a mysterious dark tower ordered by [x] was achieved. Many people are said to have fled the capital city, giving terrifying accounts of unbelievable events. They say a mysterious light appeared from the top of the tower, rising like a column into the skies, where a dark thunderstorm inexplicably materialized. Soon, it was followed by a black rain that fell onto the unexpecting crowds below that had gathered to watch the event. The people fell sick from an invisible disease that stroke as fast as the storm had appeared. They screamed in agony there, rolling into the ground. Meanwhile, those who had somehow been spared by the rains feld the city in terror, abandoning all their belongings and families. Some say they didn't die, and described how the afflicted howled in horror while their looks transformed and their skin turned green.

#ch_palentir7_2#1
Since then, nobody has heard of anyone from the city. Those who went there in the following days haven't been seen again, and most people are now too afraid to try. No one knows what terrible things may be happening there or what really happened to the afflicted, in what was known until now as the capital of the [y].

#ev_animlv#1
Wildlife is leaving [x]

#ev_animlv_1#1
The thriving activity of [x] is starting to disturb the wildlife of the territory. Hunters are reporting a gradual decrease in wildlife in the surroundings of the city: animals are getting disturbed by the proximity of Porcish activities and noises and gradually migrating to more quiet lands.

#ev_animlv_2#1
At this rate, hunters think the territory will soon become devoid of sustainable wildlife to hunt and that they'll have to cease their activities.

#ev_asylm_3#1
Their pursuers are not far behind, and your tribe is now their only hope. They beg for asylum and safety, offering to pledge their loyalty to our people if we accept to protect them. If we do, we will have to fight their pursuers!

#ev_clnyevlv_2#1
They have integrated our great nation as one of our subordinates and formally ratified the colonial treaty binding them to us and agreeing to a tax of 5% of their incomes in addition to the duties of their new title in the nation.

#ev_form_ovrdrft_1#1
The population of [x], home of our formation '[y]', is insufficient to maintain this formation! There isn't enough new young adult porcos to replace the ones aging and because of this we will be unable to maintain its current headcount and the formation will gradually lose units until this is fixed.

#ev_form_ovrdrft_2#1
Maybe we should consider downsizing to reduce the population over-draft in [x], or we could relocate this formation to another territory that could support them better. If we don't act, this formation will slowly decay!

#ev_frndgift#1
Gift of friendship in [x]

#ev_frndgift_1#1
A group of nomad travellers passed through our small village of [x]. They stayed for a few days, sharing stories and befriending some of our locals.

[x] is now inactive and his position is up for succession. He designated you as his heir, and you can therefore immediately take his place within the Nation.

#ev_heirprop_2#1
If you agree, your positions will be immediately swapped: you will inherit his rank and subordinates while he inherits yours, becoming your own subordinate. Depending on your new title's privileges, you might then be able to remove him entirely from the Nation, dismantle his territories, or reorganize the hierarchy to recover your past subordinates or move him further down.

#ev_knowtrav#1
The knowledgable traveler

#ev_knowtrav_1#1
One day, an old pig arrived in our village of [x], his feet weary from the many travels he had made. He was a lonely hermit, living and travelling alone for many years now. 

#ev_knowtrav_2#1
He told the tale of the ancient people he belonged to, who perished a long time ago from a mysterious disease that he was the only one to miraculously recover from, fleeing away from his land. He also told stories of how his people used to live: incredible stories about things they did that none here had ever though off. There was much to learn from his teachings as he seemed to come from a more refined, a mysterious people. 

#ev_knowtrav_3#1
But the wonder and influence he gained among the tribe started to upset its more dominant members, who felt their position threatened... What should we do about it ?

Should we welcome them into our tribe ?

#ev_migtrib_c1#1
"Yes, we need the extra workforce. Let them be welcomed among us."

#ev_migtrib_c2#1
"No! We can't afford extra mouths to feed."

#ev_nagwif#1
The nagging wife

#ev_nagwif_1#1
One porco of the village of [x], exasperated by the constant naggings of his Sow, decided to go on a lonely retreat in the wilderness to hunt, and thus he disappeared for several days.

#ev_palntrch1_1#1
You do not hear any answer. There is no voice in your head. You just suddenly... know. Your wish has been granted, and the stone has answered you with a gift of Wisdom. In front of you, the stone has vanished.

#ev_palntrch1_2#1
You have received instructions of how to build monolithic black artifacts that will increase the happiness, wealth, wisdom, and prestige of all the inhabitants of the territories where they are erected.

#ev_palntrch2_2#1
You have received instructions of how to build a gigantic tower of black stone that will promises to grant your desire for domination and power only once you complete its construction. You know you must build it. It's time to write down the plans you have been gifted with and to call upon your best engineers and builders to start preparations, it's going to be a long and expensive construction work.

#ev_palntrch2_3#1
Be wary, for the news of your decision will spread, and your allies will soon know of your betrayal and sinister intent. They might attempt to eliminate you before you get to complete the construction of the tower and unlock its powers.

#ev_palntrch2_fx#1
You will become the Dark Lord

#ev_palntrch2_o_1#1

#ev_palntruse#1
Using the palentir

#ev_palntruse_1#1
You cannot detach your eyes from looking at the stone. Shining of indescribable colours it seems to be refracting a space much bigger than itself, like a window into something else. 

#ev_palntruse_2#1
As you lay your hands on the black stone, you immediately feel a powerful and overwhelming energy going through your body. The surrounding air is electrified. The stormy clouds moving inside the stone start swirling faster, and reveal a growing light coming far away from the insides of the globe.

#ev_palntruse_3#1
You feel a presence. There are no signs of it, you don't see it, you don't hear it. But you know it's there. And you know it's asking for your deepest desire, promising you to make it a reality. What will it be?

#ev_palntruse_c1#1
"I want the power to secure the prosperity and happiness of my people for the ages to come."

#ev_palntruse_c2#1

#ev_rebljoin_c2#1
Refuse

#ev_regbear#1
Bad bears in [x]

#ev_regbear_1#1
A small group of bears came wandering in the territory of [x]. During the night, they entered the village and started to rampage through our food stocks and supplies.

#ev_regbear_c1#1
"Everyone, just pretend to sleep..."

#ev_regbear_c2#1
Time to fight some bears!

#ev_regwolf#1
Hungry wolves in [x]!

#ev_regwolf_1#1
A pack of hungry wolves has arrived in the territory of [x], probably attracted by our food stocks! During the night, they woke up the whole tribe with their frightening howlings which got closer and closer. At dawn, their dark silhouettes were spotted around the village.

#ev_regwolf_2#1
All the warriors rushed to their weapons and gathered, ready to fight off the incoming wolf pack and to protect the village's people and stocks!

#ev_spdboost#1
Speed boost!

#ev_spdboost_1#1
As a newly created character, to enjoy a dynamic start, you are awarded a temporary x[x] SPEED BOOST during your first [y] minutes of playing!

#ev_spdboost_2#1
This bonus, as long as it remains active, modifies the following stats of your character:

#ev_spdboost_3#1
- Production and consumption of resources in your territories happens at a faster rate, as the production cycle is reduced by [x].

#ev_spdboost_4#1
- Population growth evolves faster as the duration of a normal generation is reduced by [x].

#ev_spdboost_5#1
- Research speed is increased by [x].

#ev_spdboost_6#1
- Construction speed is increased by [x].

#ev_spwn_clny#1
Leading the colony

#ev_spwn_clny_1#1
After many years of slow development and quiet leadership from obedient administrators, the colony of [x] attached to the [y] is now ready to become a political entity of its own. You have gained their trust and been promoted to become the first true leader of [x] as the region is awarded a new administrative and political status within the [p1], under the patronage of the [y]. Its is time for [x] to make a name for itself and leave its mark in the history of Porcokind. 

#ev_spwn_clny_2#1
You have become the first ruler of a colony previously founded by another player. This region is therefore now evolving and becoming its own political entity ruled by you. However, you start as a member of an existing Nation, and by default under the patronage of the colony's original founder: the [y]. As a new branch of his culture, you also start with all the knowledges of the founders. As an ex-colony, be warned that you also start with a treaty binding you to his Nation, meaning you won't be able to leave it without breaking it and suffering penalties or even war. But this can also be a good thing: you are not starting alone and can seek protection and help from your superiors in the Nation, helping your development. It is probably a wise idea to start by reaching out to your superior and founder to greet him and establish friendly relations. Then who knows, maybe one day it will be time for [x] to claim its independence!

#ev_spwn_newld#1
New leadership

#ev_spwn_newld_1#1
The region of [x], in need of new leadership, has chosen you for the task. 

#ev_spwn_newld_2#1
You have taken over a previously leader-less region, either because it was abandoned by its previous owner or because its people rebelled against him. You are therefore a new free and independent sovereign entity free of all treaties, starting with a single region. Your starting knowledges are inherited from the pre-existing buildings in the region. Be weary: you might face the hostility of your region's previous owner if he's still around.

#ev_spwn_succ#1
Succession

#ev_spwn_succ_1#1
[x] of the [y] has left his position after many years of service. You have been named as successor and have now inherited control of all the possessions and duties of the [y].

#ev_spwn_succ_2#1
You have taken over a character that became inactive for remaining unplayed for too long by its previous owner. You are therefore picking up where it was left. You inherited all its regions, units, diplomatic relations and knowledges, and you might be part of an existing Nation. 

#ev_stormwood#1
Stormy night in [x]

#ev_stormwood_1#1
A violent storm raged all night in [x], with strong winds. Luckily, none was harmed, and the village didn't sustain any damage.

#ev_stormwood_2#1
In the morning however, the villagers noticed that a few tall old trees had fallen nearby, making it an easy free supply of wood! 

#ev_territdisabled#2
Territorial status of '[x]' lost!

#ev_territdisabled_1#2
The territorial status '[p1]' of '[x]' was lost because the territory no longer met its requirements, and it has decayed to '[p2]'.

#ev_tradenmds#1
Trading nomads in [x]

#ev_tradenmds_1#1
A caravan of trading nomads has arrived in [x] and are offering to sell us some precious shells in exchange for some goods!

#ev_traitrvq#1
Revoking Trait '[x]'

#ev_traitrvq_1#1
You are in the process of revoking the Cultural Trait '[x]'.

#ev_traitrvq_2#1
You may only revoke one Trait at a time, and it is a slow process that requires a lot of time.

#ev_traitrvq_fx#1
The Cultural Trait will be revoked.

#ev_traitrvq_o_1#1
Cultural modification pending...

#ev_traitrvq_o_2#1
Once completed, the Trait will be revoked and it's cost in Civilization Points will be recovered. If the trait has multiple levels, only 1 level will be removed by this process.

#ev_votesucc#1
Time to vote!

#ev_votesucc_1#1
[x], your superior, is now inactive, and his position is up for succession. It's time to vote to designate who amongst his subordinates will be chosen to replace him.

#ev_votesucc_2#1
Once a successor is elected, his position will be immediately swapped with [x] and he will inherit his rank and subordinates. The predecessor, by default, is automatically moved to the newly elected successor's previous position where he can then be further managed as a subordinate (dismantled, expelled, replaced...).

#ev_votesucc_rslt#1
[p2] has been elected [x]

#ev_votesucc_rslt_1#1
[p2] has been elected [x], succeeding to [p1]. 

#ev_votesucc_rslt_2#1
[p2] won the election with [p3] votes out of [p4] cast votes.

#ev_votesucc_won#1

#ev_vp_complet_1#1
We have completed the victory mission "[y]" before anyone else and earned its reward, proving to everyone that we are a glorious people!

#ev_vp_fail#1
[x] has completed a victory mission!

#ev_vp_fail_1#1
The people of [x] have completed the victory mission "[y]" before us!

#ev_xplr_abvil#1
'[x]' found an abandoned village.

#ev_xplr_abvil_1#1
While exploring the lands, our group '[x]' stumbled upon the remains of a bonded primitive village of a few huts. Cautiously, the Porcos started to inspect these remains and came to the conclusion that whoever lived there are now long gone. "They seem to have abandoned many things here. Who knows for what reasons the people who lived there decided to leave, but they didn't take much with them!", concluded the group leader.

#ev_xplr_abvil_2#1
Although many things have spoiled or decayed with time, some still appear to be in good enough condition to be of interest to us. Should we search the village and scavenge what we can ?

#ev_xplr_abvil_c1#1
"Yes, search the abandoned village and let's take what we can!"

#ev_xplr_abvil_c2#1
"No, let's leave things as they are, we have no time for this."

#ev_xplr_amazn#1
Amazons!

#ev_xplr_amazn_1#1
While exploring a dense tropical forest, our porcos '[x]' heard an enchanting melody. As they approached the location from which the music came from, they discovered a magnificent show sitting at the edge of a pond, languorously sliding her fingers between the strings of a wooden harp. The explorers were captivated by so much beauty and lowered their guards.

#ev_xplr_amazn_2#1
After finishing her song, the sow delicately stood up, grabbed a short bow and shot an arrow in the direction of the explorers, accompanied by other warrior maidens who had sprung everywhere around them. 

#ev_xplr_amazn_c1#1
�I thought the Amazons were a legend� Defend yourselves!�

#ev_xplr_avlch#1
Avalanche!

#ev_xplr_avlch_1#1
As our group was travelling in a difficult terrain, a sudden avalanche took half of our people and supplies! What are we even doing there?!

#ev_xplr_bdts#1
Bandits ambushed our formation '[x]'!

#ev_xplr_bdts_1#1
While our formation '[x]' of [p2] Porcos was traveling through the wilderness, they happened at some point to pass through a small, narrow pass nested between 2 hills. The sun was high and the Porcos were tired of the long journey and carrying of all the goods the troop had with them.

#ev_xplr_bdts_2#1
Unsurprisingly, a small group of about 20 ambushed bandits suddenly emerged on both sides, surrounding our troops. Their leader moved forwarded, and made a simple demand: "Give us all yerr loot or be bacon!". What should we do?

#ev_xplr_bdts_c1#1
"We ain't afraid of no Pigbandits!"

#ev_xplr_bdts_c2#1
Give them what they want.

#ev_xplr_bears#1
Bears!

#ev_xplr_bears_1#1
Our explorers of '[x]' had setup camp in unknown lands for the night when, at dawn, they woke up to unusual rumpus. Horrified, they saw a group of 3 huge bears scavenging through their inventory and supplies lying next to the camp.

#ev_xplr_bears_2#1
One of the porcos sleeping close to where the bears were, startled by this realization, made a move which had the unfortunate consequence of calling the attention of one of the beasts. The animal, angry and hungry, ran up to the poor bastard and decided it was time for a bacon breakfast.

#ev_xplr_bears_c1#1
Everyone pretends to sleep. Poor ol' Jenkins...

#ev_xplr_bears_c2#1
"Die, you ugly fat beasts!"

#ev_xplr_birds#1
Fearless birds

#ev_xplr_birds_1#1
'[x]' were camping in a forest after a long day of walking in these unknown lands. Night was coming, and all the porcos were gathered around campfires. That's they heard a noise in a nearby bush, from which emerged a bunch of dumblooking fat birds unknown to them. The beasts seemed oblivious of their presence, picking on things on the forest floor as if they were alone on earth.

#ev_xplr_birds_2#1
"Well... Looks like fresh meat's back on the menu, boys!", grinned the group's leader: by morning, all the birds had went to meet their maker. What a lucky hunt! The group, in the morning, left with a fullbelly and a new stocks of fresh meat.

#ev_xplr_blizzard#1
Viscous blizzard

#ev_xplr_blizzard_1#1
A viscous blizzard immobolized our expedition of '[x]' for many days. Many of them did not make it while the survivors consumed all the remaining food supplies. There is nothing to eat in these bleak lands!

#ev_xplr_brkleg#1
Broken leg

#ev_xplr_brkleg_1#1
One of our explorers managed to break his leg in a misstep while walking on a portion of difficult terrain, and is now slowing down the whole group. What should we do ?

#ev_xplr_brkleg_c1#1
Wait for him to recover.

#ev_xplr_brkleg_c2#1
Abandon him, there is no place for the weak!

#ev_xplr_civlost#1
Defenseless explorers lost!

#ev_xplr_civlost_1#1
Sending defenseless civilians to explore unknown foreign lands is a risky and dangerous decision. Our explorers '[x]' disappeared and were never heard of again: who knows what ill fate was bestowed upon them...

#ev_xplr_cliff#1
Clumsy Porco

#ev_xplr_cliff_1#1
While our explorers were walking along the edge of a tall cliff, one clumsy, Porco tripped and fell to his death.

#ev_xplr_cptsow#1
Captive sows

#ev_xplr_cptsow_1#1
A scout of the expedition '[x]' just reported the presence of a band of warriors in the area. Judging by the appearance of their camp, their presence in the territory is just temporary. 

#ev_xplr_cptsow_2#1
In the center of their bivouac, the scout has spotted a large wooden cage filled with captive sows. We do not know the intentions of these warriors, nor the circumstances in which these sows were caught, but their fate seem quite unpleasant. 

#ev_xplr_cptsow_c1#1
Fight the captors to free the sows.

#ev_xplr_cptsow_c2#1
Do not get involved.

#ev_xplr_drnkfl#1
The drunken fool

#ev_xplr_drnkfl_1#1
Our expedition '[x]' encountered a small nomadic tribe. The members of this tribe were very kind and welcoming. Never had our explorers met such friendly fellows. 

#ev_xplr_drnkfl_2#1
After a few pleasant days in their company, our porcos finally had to leave, and a ceremony was held in their honor the day before their departure. For the occasion, the nomads brought out a majestic statue of their idol: A squatting porco with two heads: one of wood and the other of gold.

#ev_xplr_drnkfl_3#1
During the festivities, one of our porcos, emboldened by alcohol, beheaded the golden head of the statue. This sparked great outrage from the tribe, and the thief was immediately attached and condemned to death for this great sacrilege.

#ev_xplr_drnkfl_c1#1
Let the nomads execute your porco and leave.

#ev_xplr_drnkfl_c2#1
Fight the nomads and free your drunken fool.

#ev_xplr_drnriv#1
River drowning

#ev_xplr_drnriv_1#1
While crossing a river, one of our explorers fell in the water. The poor hog didn't know how to swim, and the currents carried him away before anyone could help him.

#ev_xplr_egg#1
The curious hog

#ev_xplr_egg_1#1
Our explorers of '[x]' stumbled upon an abandoned nest containing a few large eggs: enough to make a juicy omelet. One curious hog decided to keep his egg, depriving himself of  the tasty meal. During days, he carried it around, and he slept next to it at nights. This went on for dozens of days, attracting him mockery from his companions. 

#ev_xplr_egg_2#1
One morning, under the curious hog's scrutiny, the egg hatched and from it emerged a tiny fluffy ostrich. Since then, it's been following its benefactor everywhere he goes, and the rest of the group even came to consider the bird as their troop's mascot.

#ev_xplr_elegsow#1
The elegant sow

#ev_xplr_elegsow_1#1
During their journey through an unexplored territory, the expedition of '[x]' met a procession led by an elegant sow, comfortably seated on a palanquin. The two groups decided to travel together temporarily in order to benefit from mutual protection. 

#ev_xplr_elegsow_2#1
The porcos in the cortege barely spoke a word. Unlike the other members of her group, the matriarch was very dynamic and talkative. She said she was versed in the arts of botany and could prepare all kinds of miraculous remedies and ointments. When the time came for dinner, she served some of her specialties.  In order to wash it down, she also offered holy drinks concocted by her. Upon finishing the strange mixture, the explorers felt better than they had ever felt before. They thought the drink was blessed and that the mighty sow was of divine nature for being able to conceive such a substance. The following month, they were offered the holy mixture whenever they asked for it. They soon became addicted to the delicious drug of the Hag. They became her puppets, drained of all their wills, just like all the other unfortunate fellows in the procession.

#ev_xplr_elegsow_3#1
A few of them couldn�t stand it any longer and decided to flee during the night. The next days, they wandered aimlessly, struggling against the lack of drug. After a long and tough weaning, they finally recovered. Just a few porcos of the former expedition party are still there. All the others have been bewitched by the extremely addictive concoction of the hag. 

#ev_xplr_freez1#1
Glacial night

#ev_xplr_freez1_1#1
Travelling in such a glacial weather requires constant supplies, including wood to keep fires alive in the camp during nights. Good thing our expedition of '[x]' still had some wood to survive a particularly glacial night.

#ev_xplr_freez2#1
Glacial night

#ev_xplr_freez2_1#1
After a particularly glacial night, having nothing to keep themselves warm,  many of members of the '[x]' expedition fell asleep, never to wake up again.

#ev_xplr_grplost#1
Explorers lost!

#ev_xplr_grplost_1#1
It is very dangerous to travel these unknown lands in a small group. Sadly, our explorer disappeared and were never heard of again. 

#ev_xplr_grplost_2#1
Who knows what happened to them... Maybe we should consider sending a bigger expedition next time, to increase our chances of success.

#ev_xplr_hsttrib#1
'[x]' is attacked by an hostile tribe!

#ev_xplr_hsttrib_1#1
Bad news! While '[x]' was walking across new unknown lands, they suddenly found themselves surrounded by a group of a demi-dozen hostile natives. They came from nowhere... We probably stepped to close to their territory, or maybe they just don't like our snouts. Before the porcos could even realize what was happening, the primitive warriors was already attacking...

#ev_xplr_icehole#1
Bloody ice-hole!

#ev_xplr_icehole_1#1
These lands are treacherous. While progressing on a difficult terrain, a few porcos of our expedition '[x]' fell to their death as ice broke under them, revealing a deep sinkhole.

#ev_xplr_invlstsea#1
'[x]' lost supplies to the sea.

#ev_xplr_invlstsea_1#1
One unskilled sailor didn't properly attach a crate of supplies the ship was carrying and during a turbulent night with strong winds, the crate fell into the sea, and we lost its contents!

#ev_xplr_jnglsnek#1
Jungle snake

#ev_xplr_jnglsnek_1#1
While '[x]' were making their way into the dense rainforest, one of our explorers was bitten by a jet-black snake. The creeping reptile then immediately vanished behind a bush. After a few hours, the injured porcos complained of feeling dizzy and having a blurred vision. He finally died in the night, unable to breathe. 

#ev_xplr_lckyfsh#1
Lucky fishing

#ev_xplr_lckyfsh_1#1
Our explorers of '[x]' were camping on the banks of a river for the night. It was a sunny late afternoon, and the water was crystal clear. That's when one porco spotted them: giant fat fishes swimming in the shallow waters! They were so slow the group could pick them up effortlessly.

#ev_xplr_lckyfsh_2#1
The group fed well that night. They also gutted and smoked a lot more fish to take with them on their journey.

#ev_xplr_lstjngl#1
Lost in the jungle

#ev_xplr_lstjngl_1#1
The porcos of '[x]' had been wondering in this bloody jungle for days, harassed by the heat and lost. It wasn't long before the one group turned into 2 groups... "Hey Mr Jenkins, I swear I already saw this damn tree 2 days ago!" said Porkypigs. "Common, maybe we'll find the rest of the group soon! Let's keep waking!". But they never did. However, they did find a nest of flesh eating flies the size of a hand when Mr Jenkins decided it was a good time to poke a suspicious hole in a tree with a stick in an attempt to find something to eat.

#ev_xplr_lstjngl_c1#1
"Bloody Mr Jenkins!" 

#ev_xplr_luckstrk#1
Lucky strike

#ev_xplr_luckstrk_1#1
Our explorers '[x]' were ascending the steep slopes of a newly discovered territory when they started to feel the ground moving under their feet.  The piece of land on which the group was standing sharply broke away, causing a massive landslide. 

#ev_xplr_luckstrk_2#1
Many of our porcos were injured, but luckily all of them survived. As they got back on their feet, they noticed a shiny protuberance from afar.  As they approached it, they discovered an enormous deposit of ore, which had been laid bare by the landslide. 

#ev_xplr_mahout#1
The mahouts

#ev_xplr_mahout_1#1
During their peregrinations in unexplored lands, the porcos of  '[x]' halted in a small hamlet of peaceful mahouts. The locals owned a couple of healthy elephants. Taming these big creatures is a long and laborious process, and sometimes their wild instincts take control again. 

#ev_xplr_mahout_2#1
As our explorers were about to leave, the enormous pachyderms suddenly went berserk. They made a breach in the fence and brought chaos in the hamlet, grinding the huts, putting everything upside down. As the situation became desperate, one of our porcos approached carefully the two furious elephants. Against all odds, the enraged animals calmed down instantly. Lying down on their stomachs, they raised their trunks towards the porcos, in sign of prostration. The local population was stunned and thought our porcos was a divine being.  They all knelt in his direction and shouted: �The father of elephants!�

#ev_xplr_mahout_3#1
After that, the mahouts seemed to worship our porcos and wished to join us with their herd.

#ev_xplr_mahout_c1#1
Enroll them.

#ev_xplr_mahout_c2#1
Refuse and leave.

#ev_xplr_map#1
Friendly tribe offers '[x]' a map of the territory.

#ev_xplr_map_1#1
Our formation '[x]' was well received by natives in a small village, where they spent a few days to rest. The villagers offered our porcos to teach them all about the surrounding territory that they know very well: 

#ev_xplr_map_2#1
"Sniffingwind here is the village's best scout" said their chief. "He knows all the ins and outs of these lands. If you wish, Sniffingwind can show you how to travel in the territory, he's never been in trouble. He'll tell you what areas to avoid, what places are dangerous, and where to pass. In the meantime you're welcome to stay in our small village!" Should we stay a little more and accept their help?

#ev_xplr_menlstsea#1
'[x]' was hit by a storm.

#ev_xplr_menlstsea_1#1
The sky had been threatening all evening: a wall of dark clouds coming from the horizon towards them. The captain tried to escape it, but unsuccessfully. It was too big, it moved too fast, and the ship was too tiny. They had to face it, and by nightfall, it had engulfed them.

#ev_xplr_menlstsea_2#1
It was a terrible night all the porcos will forever remember. Waves almost capsized the frail ship multiple times, but fortunately and against all odds, their loyal embarkation hanged on. Not everyone was there in the morning, and many porcos lost brothers that night. They will never mention it again, but all will remember forever the desperate calls for help of those who fell in the sea during the storm while they watched, helpless, as they drifted inexorably away from the ship.

#ev_xplr_mourn#1
The mourning tribe

#ev_xplr_mourn_1#1
Our explorers of '[x]' were exploring new lands when they encountered a dozen of mourning porcos, burying a sow and a piglet. After a poignant funeral, they told our porcos that they formerly belonged to a much larger group that had been slowly decimated by multiple bandit attacks and epidemics. They were running out of supplies now and had lost all hope of salvation.

#ev_xplr_mourn_c1#1
Offer them to join your expedition.

#ev_xplr_mourn_c2#1
Attack them and take their remaining supplies.

#ev_xplr_natrprov#1
Nature provides

#ev_xplr_natrprov_1#1
'[x]', while travelling across the land, stumbled upon a small patch of fertile land covered with lustrous plants filled with vegetables and fruits ready for the picking.

#ev_xplr_natrprov_2#1
Sometimes, the nature is generous and provides. The porcos stopped for a few hours and feasted with this unexpected gift, and took the rest with them.

#ev_xplr_orphel#1
The orphaned pachyderm

#ev_xplr_orphel_1#1
Our explorers of '[x]' had been marching for hours under the sun of arid lands when they heard weird calling noises that seemed desperate. They walked to a deep muddy hole, at the bottom of which was stuck a young pachyderm calf and her mother. While the little elephant was alive, the other was no longer. 

#ev_xplr_orphel_2#1
By cutting branches from dead trees nearby, the group worked tirelessly for a few hours to dig and help the calf out of the hole. As soon as it got out, the scared animal first ran away. But grateful and having nowhere else to go, the little pachyderm apparently took a liking of the group and started following them ever since. First at at a respectful distance, and everyday closer until it ended up marching right in the middle of their group and sleeping next to their camp at nights.

#ev_xplr_orphel_c1#1
Keep the calf as a pet elephant

#ev_xplr_orphel_c2#1
"Looks like fresh meat's back on the menu boys!"

#ev_xplr_polfood1#1
Icy desert

#ev_xplr_polfood1_1#1
Travelling in freezing hostile barren lands requires constant supplies, including food, as often there is absolutely nothing to eat in this icy desert. Good thing our expedition of '[x]' still had some food supplies to survive another day.

#ev_xplr_polfood2#1
Icy desert

#ev_xplr_polfood2_1#1
Sadly, now out of food supplies and unable to find anything to eat in these dreadful lands, our starving expedition '[x]' disappeared into this glacial white unforgiving desert and where never heard of again.

#ev_xplr_ruinorph#1
The orphan survivors

#ev_xplr_ruinorph_1#1
Our explorers '[x]' had spotted a large cloud of smoke on the horizon, rising and covering the sky of its dark coat. Our porcos cautiously approached the location from which the fire originated and discovered smoldering ruins, filled with the stench of death: lifeless bodies littered the ground all around, stripped of all valuables. Even the cattle had not been spared. 

#ev_xplr_ruinorph_2#1
Night was falling, and the members of the expedition did not intend to spend more time in the middle of this macabre scene. As they were about to leave, their attention was caught by hundreds of small green lights taking off from a nearby bush: fireflies. Something had disrupted all these insects.

#ev_xplr_ruinorph_3#1
By searching more closely, our porcos found dozens of children hidden in the vegetation. They all looked very weak and desperate. They undoubtedly belonged to the village in ruins and their chances of survival seem very small if no help is given.

#ev_xplr_ruinorph_c1#1
Adopt the orphaned piglets.

#ev_xplr_ruinorph_c2#1
Leave.

#ev_xplr_rwave#1
Rogue wave!

#ev_xplr_rwave_1#1
The sea is dangerous and treacherous. It was a sunny day, the sea appeared to be calm and the breeze was nice. The porcos were relaxed, though eager to be back on land. But suddenly, one pig squealed, pointing at the horizon on starboard. Everyone looked in terror at what looked like an improbable wall of water coming in the direction of the ship. Before anyone could do anything, the tiny ship was hit and capsized. 

#ev_xplr_rwave_2#1
There was nothing they could have done against such a treacherous and unpredictable event: they did not stand a chance. Ship and pigs were dragged to the bottom of the sea, never to be seen again.

#ev_xplr_shpwrk#1
Shipwreck

#ev_xplr_shpwrk_1#1
The porcos '[x]' were exploring the coast of unknowned lands when they found various pieces of a recent ship wreck brought back on the shore by the tide. A little further away, they found the bodies of its unfortunate sailors lying down on the beach. 

#ev_xplr_shpwrk_2#1
Most of them had drowned, but some porcos could still breathe: with some food and rest, the survivors could be put back on their feet.

#ev_xplr_shpwrk_c1#1
Feed the shipwrecked porcos and enroll them in the group.

#ev_xplr_shpwrk_c2#1
Pillage the shipwreck and its survivors.

#ev_xplr_sick#1
Sick explorers

#ev_xplr_sick_1#1
Many porcos in the expedition '[x]' have contracted a fever. The disease doesn't seem to heal and even got worse day after day. The sick porcos are struck by hallucinations and delusions. They sweat profusely and can no longer walk with the rest of the expedition party. 

#ev_xplr_sick_2#1
The valid members of our expedition have to make a choice: either set camp for a while in the vicinity to feed the sick and hope that they'll recover, or leave without them.

#ev_xplr_sick_c1#1
Stop and feed the sick until their condition improves. 

#ev_xplr_sick_c2#1
"These unfortunate Porcos are a burden. Let's keep moving!"

#ev_xplr_slowed#1
Challenging terrain

#ev_xplr_slowed_1#1
These unknown lands proved particularly challenging to cross: our explorers got lost multiple times and lost a lot of time, and it took them much longer than expected to reach their destination.

#ev_xplr_slprats#1
Damn rats!

#ev_xplr_slprats_1#1
Our expedition, '[x]' was forced to take shelter in the first rocky cavity we could find as a thunderstorm suddenly broke out. Rain-soaked to the skin, we all clustered together and tried to rest despite the deafening noise of the tempest.

#ev_xplr_slprats_2#1
In the morning, the rain finally stopped and calm returned. Half asleep, we heard squeaks coming from our food containers. We soon realized we were surrounded by rats. The malicious rodents had taken advantage of the noise to feast on our provisions all night. 

#ev_xplr_snakes#1
Snakes in a plain

#ev_xplr_snakes_1#1
Our formation '[x]' was slowly crossing a seemingly endless plain covered in tall thick grass the height of a porco when one of them felt a sharp pain on his feet: he had been bitten by a colorful snake that quickly disappeared in the grass. There was nothing we could do for the poor bastard: in a few minutes his leg had doubled volume, and he met a gruesome death.

#ev_xplr_snakes_2#1
That, unfortunately, was just a beginning as by the time the group managed to escape the plain, 2 more had been bitten and followed the same fate. This plain was literally infested with vicious snakes.

#ev_xplr_snakes_c1#1
"I've had it with these motherfuckin' snakes!"

#ev_xplr_snglost#1
Explorer lost!

#ev_xplr_snglost_1#1
It is very dangerous to travel these unknown lands alone. Sadly, our explorer disappeared and was never heard of again. 

#ev_xplr_snglost_2#1
Who knows what happened to him... Maybe we should consider sending a bigger expedition next time, to increase our chances of success.

#ev_xplr_sngseal#1
Dangerous sea

#ev_xplr_sngseal_1#1
The sea is no place for lone navigators. It is unforgiving and unmerciful: our few travellers disappeared and were never heard of again.

#ev_xplr_sngseal_2#1
Who knows what happened to them... Maybe we should consider sending a bigger expedition next time, if we want to stand a chance!

#ev_xplr_storm#1
Ships lost in a terrible storm!

#ev_xplr_storm_1#1
The sea is dangerous and moody. Before anyone had time to react, a calm breeze turned into a terrifying storm with waves taller than hills and a sky darker than the night. Our ship, sadly, was no match for this storm. The porcos fought bravely, but pigs and ships were all claimed by the sea by the next morning. I'm afraid we've lost the whole expedition.

#ev_xplr_strvtrib#1
The starving tribe

#ev_xplr_strvtrib_1#1
The porcos of '[x]' had spotted a small group of people away from them, walking on the side of a hill. The next day, in the morning, the same group was spotted again, this time closer, and the Porcos decided to go meet them: it was a small group of a few families, with piglets and sows, and they didn't seem to be of any threat.

#ev_xplr_strvtrib_2#1
When moving closer, their condition became horrifyingly clear: these people were walking skeletons, starving. They walked slowly, and in their eyes was no hope. They didn't seem to notice the presence of the group getting closer to them until one of us stepped literally in front of them.

#ev_xplr_strvtrib_3#1
We offered them some of our provisions, and it wasn't before the 2nd day that they finally exchanged a few words with the group and told us their story. They used to be a bigger and prosperous tribe, living of hunting and gathering, until they were chased away from their lands by a more powerful tribe. They had lost all their precious tools and weapons, and most of the strongest Porcos of their tribe had died fighting. Since then, the survivors had wandered the land unable to hunt, slowly starving.

#ev_xplr_strvtrib_c1#1
"Join us, we will offer you a new home!"

#ev_xplr_strvtrib_c2#1
We can't take care of these people. Let's wish them good luck and move on. 

#ev_xplr_thirst#1
Unforgiving desert

#ev_xplr_thirst_1#1
Our formation '[x]' wandered too far in unknown arid lands. For days, they could not find any source of fresh water. The porcos desperately searched for water, but it was no easy task in these desertic foreign lands. By the time they found a muddy puddle to quench their thirst, many of them had been lost to the vultures and the unforgiving sun of these lands.

#ev_xplr_thirst_2#1
Maybe we should have avoided venturing too far in such a hostile territory.  

#ev_xplr_tribrem#1
Tribe's remains

#ev_xplr_tribrem_1#1
Our explorers of '[x]' stumbled upon the remains of an unfortunate small group of nomads. By the looks of it, they had died a long time ago, in circumstances the group couldn't figure out. All their belongings appeared to be still intact next to them.

#ev_xplr_tribrem_c1#1
Scavenge their remains to recover what we can.

#ev_xplr_tribrem_c2#1
Give them a proper burrial.

#ev_xplr_wellrest#1
Hospitable natives

#ev_xplr_wellrest_1#1
Our explorers met friendly natives that offered them their hospitality. After a good rest and plentiful meals, our expedition bid them farewell and left reinvigorated.

#ev_xplr_wiseold#1
The Wise Oldpig

#ev_xplr_wiseold_1#1
As our expedition '[x]' was heading to a new unexplored territory, a group of porcos in rags crossed our path. Despite their modest appearance, they all seemed well-educated, filled with assurance and determination. Their leader, a venerable oldpig wearing a shaggy beard falling to his knees, presented himself as a philosopher. He had been roaming the world for many years, professing his thought to anyone willing to listen.

#ev_xplr_wiseold_2#1
We decided to sit with them for a moment and the wise old pig started to present his doctrine: He argued that happiness couldn't be reached by satisfying conventional desires like wealth, power, fame or pleasures of the flesh. According to his school of thought, only a simple life free from all possessions could really fulfill our souls. 

#ev_xplr_wiseold_3#1
He pleaded for hours, captivating the whole audience. His words were subtle and his reasoning logical. He was even so persuasive that many of us decided to give up all their possessions to follow him.

#ev_xplr_wolfcubs#1
Abandoned cubs

#ev_xplr_wolfcubs_1#1
Our explorers of '[x]' were caught by a violent storm and took refuge in a small cavern under a nearby cliff to wait it out. While they were busy setting camp in it, they heard strange calling noises. 

#ev_xplr_wolfcubs_2#1
Grabbing a torch, one Porco went in the back to investigate and discovered 3 distressed wolf cubs. They looked dirty and hungry, visibly abandoned for quite a while : this was no regular wolf den and there was no sign of any wolves nearby. None knew how these 3 cubs ended up here, but the group decided to adopt them. The young wolves quickly got back in shape and it wasn't long until they became loyal companions appreciated by the whole group. Well, all except for the old Clawhog whose entire family was tragically devoured by wolves when he was just a piglet. 

#ev_xplr_wolves#1
Beasts in the forest

#ev_xplr_wolves_1#1
Our explorers of '[x]' where travelling through a dense forest when at dusk, they started to feel uneasy and watched. They kept progressing in silence, nervous, while dark silhouettes seemed to follow and encircle them. 

#ev_xplr_wolves_2#1
Suddenly, a terrifying growl came from the front, stopping the group. "Wolves i tell ya!", said the old Clawhop who didn't like these beasts -to say the least- as everyone on the group knew. "Get yerr weapons ready, pigs!", he added as several growls echoed around them. From all sides they emerged, ugly bacon-eating canines.

#ev_xplrch_agreed#1
"Agreed!"

#ev_xplrch_exlnt#1
"Excellent!"

#ev_xplrch_leave#1
Leave.

#ev_xplrch_notime#1
"No, we have no time for this."

#ev_xplrch_notinterstd#1
"No, I'm not interested."

#ev_xplrch_nvrmnd#1
"No. Nevermind."

#ev_xplrch_proceed#1
"Yes, proceed!"

#ev_xplrch_shame#1
"It's a shame."

#ev_xplrch_unavail#1
You do not meet the requirements for this choice.

#ev_xplrch_vrywl#1
"Very well."

#event_c_canceldebt#1

#event_canceldebt#1
Debt canceled!

#event_canceldebt_1#1
We took the drastic measure of declaring our debt of [p1] coins null and void, announcing that we would not be paying back what we owed.

#event_canceldebt_2#1
In all our cities, the creditors of our debt are revolted that they're never getting paid what we owed them. Many people lost everything and are ruined as a consequence. The economy is destabilized and in great turmoil, not to mention the loss of the people's trust in their government. 

#event_canceldebt_3#1
As a consequence of canceling a debt of [p3]% our total GDP ([p2] coins), we are suffering a penalty of [p4] Loyalty in all our territories and you have lost [p5] of honor.

#event_form_animesc_1#1
[p2] [p3] have escaped from the surveillance of our formation '[x]' that was guarding them, and are now lost.

#event_form_animesc_2#1
Animals may escape if they are too numerous relative to their keepers or simply kept for too long in a formation's inventory. To make sure this doesn't happen again, maybe we should consider parking them in proper paddocks or carrying smaller numbers so they are less likely to escape the supervision of their assigned keepers.

#event_lowlegit#1
Negative legitimacy!

#event_lowlegit_1#1
Legitimacy is how much the people recognizes the right of your state's claims to authority. Without it, not only do we face an increasing risk of popular uprisings, but our armies might also turn against us to overthrow our illegitimate government!

#event_lowlegit_2#1
Legitimacy policies define what claims you make to assert your right as the leader of this State. These claims define the importance of all the different Legitimacy factors. To improve our situation, we could either work to improve the current factors, or reform our Legitimacy claims to rely on more beneficial ones.

#event_lowpow#1
Negative state power!

#event_lowpow_1#1
State power is the capacity of your state to manage things. Without it, we will be unable to pass reforms and the loyalty of our territories is negatively impacted which may lead to popular rebellions.

The main lead of researchers on our project of '[x]' turned out to be a dead-end, resulting in them having to restart work from scratch. Hopefully they will learn from this unfortunate experience and will be more successful next time!

#event_projfail_2#2
A project may fail if its difficulty is higher than the average intelligence of the researchers assigned to it. We could try to assign better researchers to increase our chances of success next time!

#event_projfail_3#2
Researchers had [p2]% chances of being successful, however they failed and [p3] Research points of progress have been lost. This experience has given them a bonus of +[p4]% success on their next trial.

#event_projsuc#1
Our project '[x]' was successfully completed!

#event_projsuc_1#1
Our project '[x]' has been successfully completed and we have earned its rewards!

#event_rcvidea#1
We received a new idea from [x]!

#event_rcvidea_1#1
Good news: the people of [x] have shown us their knowledge of [p1] and explained to us the rudiments of what it is and how it works.

#event_rcvidea_2#1
Based on what they shown us, we have now unlocked a new project: '[p2]', which we can attempt to complete ourselves to master the knowledge of [p1] as well!

#event_revolt#1
Popular revolt in [x]!

#event_revolt_1#1
The population of [x] are revolting against us and rebels are trying to take control of the city! If they succeed, we will lose control of this territory!

[p2]% of the population are taking arms and rebelling, including [p3] soldiers of the local garrison who have defected to the rebels. Our [p5] loyalist soldiers are facing a total of [p4] rebels.

#event_rsk_upris#1
Rebellion risk in [x]

#event_rsk_upris_1#1
The loyalty of [x] is very low and there is a high risk of imminent rebellion of its population! We need to do something about it...

#event_rsk_upris_2#1
Loyalty is reduced by factors such as : amount of local culture, strong local garrison, absence of state troops, low state power or legitimacy, number of cities and capital distance. You can open the leaderboard to see your final score.

#event_tribreb#1
Primitive tribe uprising in [x]!

#event_tribreb_1#1
The natives living in our territory of [x] have grown upset of having what they feel to be their territory occupied by us. They have taken arms and decided to treacherously attack!

#event_tribwarn#1
Stolen territory

#event_tribwarn_1#1
Beware! By creating our newest settlement of [x], we have usurped the lands of a primitive tribe that has been living there for generations. Sure, this territory looked appealing, but we will eventually pay the consequences of this action for the natives will not tolerate our presence forever.

#event_tribwarn_2#1
For now, they only watched us set camp from afar but they know these lands better than anyone and disappear everytime we try to approach them. I'm afraid we won't be able to 'deal with them' before they choose to cause trouble... We should prepare for a possible surprise attack by them. They might be preparing weapons and warriors to chase us from their lands as we speak! Or maybe this land is not worth the trouble after all and we could just pack up and leave them be?

Overexpansion!

#ev_overextend_1#3
We don't have enough Expansion Points to maintain our current territories!

#ev_overextend_2#3
Our government is not organized in a way to properly manage these extra territories. It cannot operate normally until this is resolved and it's efficiency will remain crippled by this overexpansion, represented by a big State Power penalty for every missing Expansion Point.

#ev_suborlimit#1
Too many subordinates!

#ev_suborlimit_1#1
Our current government is unable to manage this many Nation subordinates. This is causing a huge Nation maintenance penalty of State Power that must be resolved urgently!

#event_inovfail#1
Nothing to innovate in '[p2]'!

#event_inovfail_1#1
Researchers researched long and hard, but they simply found nothing and gave up.

#event_inovfail_2#1
It seems that right now, there doesn't seem to be any way to innovate in the domain of [p2]. However it may be that exploring other domains of research first can later lead to new possible innovations in this domain.
