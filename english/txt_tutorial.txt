#tuto_0_1#1
Greetings newpig! I am Sagacious Pig your tutorial assistant. 

#tuto_0_2#1
I'm here to guide you through the first steps of the game and explain how things work.

#tuto_0_c1#1
Tell me more!--1

#tuto_0_c2#1
I wanted to do the tutorial but now that i see your ugly face i'd rather skip it.--82

#tuto_1_1#1
You are currently in the world map. Each tile is a 'territory' you can explore and colonize. 

#tuto_1_2#1
At the start, most of the map is unexplored except the few territories around your tribe.

#tuto_1_c1#1
Very well... so what now ?--2--1

#tuto_10_1#1
To sustain themselves, your porcos need food and water or they will quickly die. They were carrying a bit of food with them, but no water : the first urgent thing to do is to setup a water collection point on the shore a fresh water point.

#tuto_10_c1#1
How do i do that ?--11--8

#tuto_100_1#1
How dare you!

#tuto_100_c1#1
You don't even exist. You're just a script of pseudo interactive pre-written lines here only for my personnal entertainment.--101

#tuto_101_1#1
You're lying!

#tuto_101_c1#1
I can get rid of you anytime by simply editing the .ini file of this game.--102

#tuto_102_1#1
No you can't! You will be lost in this game without me. You NEED me.

#tuto_102_c1#1
Yes i can, and i will. Right now.--103--51

#tuto_102_c2#1
Yes i could. But i'm a generous god. I will let you carry on with your purpose.--1

#tuto_103_1#1
Not before i spawn my army of Bears and exterminate your puny excuse of a tribe. Die Fetcher!

#tuto_103_c1#1
How... What kind of freakin' tutorial is this ?!--999

#tuto_104_1#1
Oh because you're such an expert in bears!

#tuto_104_c1#1
Yes i am, actually.--105

#tuto_105_1#1
Fine. If you're such an expert, then answer that: how do you call a group of bears ? If you answer right, i will leave. If you don't, you'll have to endure my tutorial.

#tuto_105_c1#1
A group of bears.--106

#tuto_105_c2#1
A band.--107

#tuto_105_c3#1
A sloth.--108

#tuto_105_c4#1
A congregation.--107

#tuto_106_1#1
You are wise, young piglet. Wiser than you look. Fair enough, i will leave you alone. But are you sure you want to skip this tutorial ?

#tuto_106_c1#1
Yes.--999

#tuto_106_c2#1
No. I won, but I will indulge your tutorial.--1

#tuto_107_1#1
Wrong! You foolish piglet! Now pay attention and suffer my neverending tutorial!

#tuto_107_c1#1
Damnit...--1

#tuto_108_1#1
You googled it, didn't you.

#tuto_108_c1#1
No.--109

#tuto_109_1#1
You did. I know it. Just admit it, or face irreversible consequences!

#tuto_109_2#1
I am the Bearmaster. If you do not come clean, i will summon my army of vengeful bears and exterminate you and your puny tribe! Then, no more tutorial for you, MISTER piglet! You will be alone in this cruel unforgiving game with it's confusing counter-intuitive UIs and menus. So think again, before doing anything foolish as to defy me. This is your last chance!

#tuto_109_c1#1
I will not!--110--51

#tuto_11_1#1
This is the building tab of the territory, where you can see all your currently available buildings and order their construction in this territory.

#tuto_11_2#1
In the first "housing" building tab, select the "Water collector" building. 

#tuto_110_1#1
You CHEATED! For this you deserve unBEARable punishment! Its time for my bears to maul your insolent tribe!

#tuto_110_c1#1
I can't beleive this...--999

#tuto_111_1#1
Now let's wait until the project is completed...

#tuto_112_1#1
There! You can now build your first solid dwelling : a primitive rustic hut. 

#tuto_112_2#1
Currently, your tribe is living in 'slums'. Slums are 1 tile dwellings that will spawn automatically whenever no proper housing is available. They will also disapear automatically when empty houses are available, as it's residents relocate into them.

#tuto_112_c1#1
What's the use of providing good houses ?--113

#tuto_113_1#1
Slums provide no bonuses while houses improve the Health and Life Quality of it's residents. Life quality increases Intelligence while Health decreases sickness, which reduces the amount of your porcos dying during each generation. 

#tuto_113_2#1
Improving both these stats will increase your population's happiness and growth, giving you more Actives to employ in buildings or armies.

#tuto_113_c1#1
Good to know!--114

#tuto_114_1#1
Your next assignement is to use your starting resources to start building your first proper huts. Once they are completed, slums will progressively disapear as population relocates into the new houses. 

#tuto_114_2#1
You can also speed up this process by manually destroying the slums. If you destroy more than there is room available, new ones will simply reappear elsewhere, so you can't lose any population!

#tuto_114_c1#1
Very well.--115

#tuto_115_1#1
This is the destroy tool. Its what you use to order the destruction of infrastuctures, clear terrain, or deconstruct building. When you right click on it, you can filter what you wish to destroy.

#tuto_115_2#1
When your order the deconstruction of a building, you will recover about half it's initial materials.

#tuto_115_c1#1
Good!--116

#tuto_116_1#1
Now complete your current assignement by building at least 10 huts for your population.

#tuto_117_1#1
Good! As a reward new families settled in your territory which will help us for to the next step: creating your first expedition to hunt and explore.

#tuto_117_c1#1
Why is that ?--131

#tuto_118_1#1
Herds are groups of animal units. They are finite and are not a permanent resource: they cannot be exploited by the Hunter building. 

#tuto_118_2#1
As 'units', they are visible from the world map and can be hunted without the need of a settlement.

#tuto_118_c1#1
How do i hunt them, then ?--119

#tuto_119_1#1
To hunt them, you have to form an expedition party.

#tuto_119_2#1
While a militia is just a stack of weapons to use by your population in case of attack, a regular 'army' is a group of actual units that are removed from your population and permanently mobilized. An army can move to other territories and perform actions like hunting.

#tuto_119_c1#1
Got it, so what do i do ?--120

#tuto_12_1#1
This building is free and does not require any workers: it simply represents a spot on the shore cleared and levelled to allow your porcos easy access to fresh water: they will get it themselves as they need it. Try to place it next to tiles of water:  it needs to have one edge adjascent to water to work.

#tuto_120_1#1
Now create a new 'Army' formation and recruit at least 10 warriors in it. 

#tuto_120_2#1
This time note that they will be removed from your current population as it's not a 'Militia', so you'll never want to recruit all your actives in an army because it would empty all it's production buildings of it's workers.

#tuto_121_1#1
Select your 'Army' formation by clicking on it's camp or by clicking it's button on the Formations tab.

#tuto_122_1#1
On your selected Formation's menu, click the "+" button to add additionnal troops to your already existing army.

#tuto_123_1#1
Armies can carry goods and have their own inventory whose capacity depends on the units in it. Carriers are non-fighting units who simply provide a lot of inventory capacity for your Formation.

#tuto_123_2#1
You need to recruit at least 3 of them.

#tuto_124_1#1
You can see your formation's inventory by clicking on it's inventory tab in it's menu.

#tuto_124_2#1
There you can see it's current inventory capacity, and you can load or unload resources from your formation into your territory.

#tuto_124_c1#1
Got it!--125

#tuto_125_1#1
Now that your first expedition is ready, go back to the worlmap view to start exploring other territories.

#tuto_126_1#1
On the worldmap view, all your formations will be visible and you can select them and give them orders. 'Militias' will also appear, but cannot be moved as they are binded to their territory!

#tuto_126_2#1
You can recruit, disband, load and unload resources directly from the worldmap as well.

#tuto_126_c1#1
Ok!--127

#tuto_127_1#1
Now beware! Only the tiles next to your tribe are visible while the rest remains hidden until you first explore it. But whenever you uncover new tiles for the first time, you group of explorers might trigger an "exploration event".

#tuto_127_c1#1
Got it.--132

#tuto_128_1#1
Now try to locate a 'herd': a group of animals units, and explore new tiles if you have to. Select the herd formation once you have found one.

#tuto_128_c1#1
I can't find any...

#tuto_129_1#1
That's a 'herd'. You can see how many animals it has and you can click on it's inventory to see it's 'loot' : the total amound of meat and leather you can recover from killing them.

#tuto_129_2#1
With your formation of warriors selected, you can right click on the tile of the territory where the herd is, and the action "Hunt" will be available.

#tuto_129_c1#1
What happens next ?--130

#tuto_13_1#1
Now that your porcos need for water is satisifed, they need sustainable sources of food as their stocks will run out soon. 

#tuto_13_c1#1
Food please!--14--10

#tuto_130_1#2
With the hunting action, it will initiate an instantaneous 'battle' between your warriors and the animals of the herd.

#tuto_130_2#2
If your warriors are sucessful, some or all of the animals loot will be transfered into your formation's inventory, which you can then bring back and unload into your territory, providing extra food to support your tribe's growth!

#tuto_130_c1#1
Excellent!--69

#tuto_131_1#1
As hunters and gatherers, you currently rely only on your natural sources of food which might quickly become insufficient for your tribe. You need to explore territories around your village and to hunt Herds to provide the extra food you'll need to support the growth of your tribe.

#tuto_131_c1#1
What are Herds ?--118

#tuto_132_1#1
These events can be dangerous but can also be rewarding, giving you new resources and units. To have any chance of successfully explore, always do so with a group of 10 or more porcos. Once a territory has been explored once, you can then move safely through them for it will not trigger any new exploration event.

#tuto_132_c1#1
Good to know!--128

#tuto_14_1#1
There is 2 kinds of natural sources of foods : edible plants and spots of wild animals. The first one can be exploited by the Farm building and the latter by the Hunter.

#tuto_14_2#1
Farms and Hunters are buildings that exploit natural resources. They need to be placed near valid resources. Now, start by trying to place a hunter.

#tuto_15_1#1
When you are placing a building that exploits natural resources, an area of tiles appears highlighted around it: it's the production range of the building.  

#tuto_15_2#1
Grey and Red tiles means there's nothing exploitable: you need to look fot the tiles that are highlighted in GREEN, indicating a valid exploitable resource for the building.

#tuto_15_3#1
Scan the territory with the building selected to look for a valid spot to place it.

#tuto_15_c1#1
How do i recognize exploitable animals ?--16

#tuto_15_c2#1
How do i recognize edible plants ?--18

#tuto_16_1#1
A natural spot of wild animals is a single tile that will appear green when placing a Hunter. It has a few visible animals walking wandering around it. One hunter is enough as it's only a single tile.

#tuto_16_c1#1
Got it.--15

#tuto_16_c2#1
I see animals but the Hunter doesnt seem to be able to exploit them.--17

#tuto_17_1#1
Sometimes animals are present in a territory as a 'herd'. Herds are depletable and temporary groups of animals and they cannot be hunted in a permanent and sustainable way through a Hunter building: you will need to manually hunt them with units. Ignore them for now.

#tuto_17_c1#1
Very well...--15

#tuto_18_1#1
Spots of edible plants are usually large patches of similar looking plants or trees. If the patch is large, you may place several Farms around it to fully exploit it.

#tuto_18_c1#1
Very well.--15

#tuto_19_1#1
You have now started satisfying the 2 urgent needs of your tribe of water and food. These 2 needs combined form something called the "Vital needs".

#tuto_19_2#1
When the Vital needs are not fully satisfied, it means some of your Porcos are suffering from malnutrition and dying.

#tuto_19_c1#1
Good to know.--20--13

#tuto_2_1#1
This is a mission event. You will sometimes get missions you can complete to unlock rewards. Here, your first task is simply to settle your tribe in your first territory.

#tuto_2_c1#1
Yes... yes... Let us begin then!--3--2

#tuto_20_1#1
This button opens an important menu: the "Territory menu". 

#tuto_20_2#1
It shows everything you need to know about the territory you are in, allowing you to check it's situation and to diagnose it's problems. Click to open it.

#tuto_21_1#1
This menu has a lot of informations combined in it. The top half is a global summary of the territory with all it's important stats in a single space.

#tuto_21_2#1
The lower half of the menu is a set of tabs, each one giving you more in-depth details about a specific territory stat: economy, growth, administration...

#tuto_21_c1#1
Ok!--22

#tuto_22_1#1
This is the important part to look for now : the global vital needs of your populaiton that i mentionned earlier. 

#tuto_22_2#1
It needs to remains more or less above 70%: meaning most people in your tribe have enough food and water not to starve to death. It's an important value you will always have to monitor.

#tuto_22_c1#1
Very well.--23--15

#tuto_23_1#1
Just above it is the territory's Growth: the current variation of your population. This is what you will be looking for the most in early game.

#tuto_23_2#1
Positive growth means your population is increasing and you will get new active Porcos you can employ in buildings. 

#tuto_23_3#1
Satisfied Vital Needs is essential to maintain a positive growth, but it's not the only factor influencing it.

#tuto_23_c1#1
Got it.--26--16

#tuto_23_c2#1
What are the factors influencing Growth?--24

#tuto_23_c3#1
How do I improve Growth?--25

#tuto_24_1#1
You can click on the "Growth" tab to access details about the global Growth of your population. Growth is the result of 2 main factors: the will of population to have children and their survival. 

#tuto_24_2#1
The will to have children is detailed in the right side column and is affected mostly by the Life Quality of the population.

#tuto_24_3#1
The survival of piglets into adulthood is affected mostly by the global Health of your population.

#tuto_24_c1#1
Got it.--26--16

#tuto_24_c2#1
So how do I improve it?--25

#tuto_25_1#1
First make sure your Vital Needs are satisfied. Then you will want to improve global Health and Life Quality as much as possible.

#tuto_25_2#1
Provide good dwellings for your population, diversified food and generally try to fill the maximum of your population's needs!

#tuto_25_c1#1
Got it.--26--16

#tuto_26_1#1
This is your current population. It's divided into groups of "Social Classes", each one represented by one button.

#tuto_26_2#1
"Inactives" is the default class of currently jobless adult Porcos available to work in new buildings. Once a porco starts working in a building, he converts to the social class the building employs.

#tuto_26_c1#1
Understood. Now what ?--27

#tuto_27_1#1
Before building new production buildings, you will want to check that you have enough inactives to work in them.

#tuto_27_2#1
You should still have a decent amount of Inactive Porcos available: let's keep them busy and move on the next mission!

#tuto_27_c1#1
I'm ready.--28--17

#tuto_28_1#1
Building things require resources and one of the most commonly required one at first is Hammers, made from Flints.

#tuto_28_2#1
You must now produce your first Hammers as your stocks will soon run out as you build. 

#tuto_28_c1#1
Ok.--29--18

#tuto_29_1#1
Hammers will be your first 'industrial product': a resource that is crafted from other resources.

#tuto_29_2#1
Hammers require flints -a natural resource- which you can produce with the Flint collector.

#tuto_29_3#1
Start by building a Flint collector in a valid location, near any gravely looking ground tiles.

#tuto_3_1#1
Events will appear  as flags on top of the screen and you can also review them all by clicking this button next to the flags.

#tuto_3_c1#1
Thank you mister Pig, shall we continue ?--4--3

#tuto_30_1#1
Very well! Now you can build the Tool maker.

#tuto_30_2#1
Unlike natural producers, industries can be placed anywhere for they do not exploit any natural resource: they combine existing ones.

#tuto_308_1#1
It looks like you'll need to build more than one Tool maker to reach +1 of Hammers production: build another one!

#tuto_309_1#1
Also make sure that your new buildings have enough workers: click on them to open their menus and check that they both have the amount of workers they need.

#tuto_309_2#1
If some are missing, you can click on the worker icon and select "Hire one" to force a worker into this building.

#tuto_309_3#1
You can you also change the employment priority to high or critical and when you force-get a worker, it will take it from buildings of lower priority.

#tuto_310_1#1
Like with Tool makers, you'll need more than one Woodcutter to reach +1 of Wood production: build a second one!

#tuto_300_1#1
Congrats! It looks like you have unlocked the knowledge of agriculture for the first time!

#tuto_300_c1#1
Indeed.--301

#tuto_300_c2#1
No, i don't need your help thank you!--998

#tuto_301_1#1
Agriculture now allows you to create fields with your gathering camps. Fields are not buildings: they are 'annexes'.

#tuto_301_2#1
An annex is constructed and linked to the building owning it. It provides it with additionnal production sources, distribution, or even bonuses such as increasing its efficiency.

#tuto_301_c1#1
Very well.--302

#tuto_302_1#1
Fields are a production annex to your gathering camps. Thanks to them you can now place new gathering camps regardless of the presence of exploitable natural resources, as you can make your own with fields!

#tuto_302_2#1
To create fields, select one of your gathering camps to open its building menu.

#tuto_303_1#1
The available annexes for a building appear on the bottom of its building menu. Click on the new Field button to place fields for this gathering camp.

#tuto_304_1#1
Fields cost hoes to create as well as one resource unit of the culture type (as seeds). Once placed they are permanent and each fields adds a new "production source" to the building they are attached to.

#tuto_304_2#1
Ground fertility affects the productivity of the fields : try placing them over the most fertile grounds (groundwater is not effective yet).

#tuto_304_c1#1
Got it!--305

#tuto_305_1#1
Each field requires workforce from its building to be exploited. If the workforce of the gathering camp is already 100% used, it is useless to add any new fields until some is available. That can happen after upgrading the building or changing policies that affect building's efficiency.

#tuto_305_c1#1
Good to know.--306

#tuto_306_1#1
Agriculture also unlocks a new type of tools required to make fields: hoes. To make them, you can click on one of your toolmakers and switch its production from hammers to hoes!

#tuto_306_c1#1
Ok!--307

#tuto_307_1#1
That's it for now, enjoy farming!

#tuto_307_c1#1
Thank you mister Sagacious Pig.--998

#tuto_31_1#1
Great, you are now producing your first Hammers!

#tuto_31_2#1
Hammers are your first type of tool. Later, you will unlock new tools which will also be required by many constructions.

#tuto_31_3#1
Unlike resources like foods, tools are not consummed by the population to satisfy their needs: it's player-used only.

#tuto_31_c1#1
Ok.--32--21

#tuto_32_1#1
This is the resource tab of your territory: it lists all the resources produced and currently in the territory's storages. This is also where you can trade,buy,sell or transport resources between territories later on.

#tuto_32_2#1
Click to open the tab.

#tuto_33_1#1
Each button shows you one type of resource currently stored or produced in the territory. On each button you can see the amount stocked, a sign indicating it's current variation, and it's local price.

#tuto_33_2#1
Now click on one of these buttons to open it's Resource Menu.

#tuto_34_1#1
The Resource Menu gives you all the details about a specific resource: production, consumption by population or industries, price...

#tuto_34_c1#1
Ok.--35--24

#tuto_35_1#1
It also gives you access to some resource-specific options. 

#tuto_35_2#1
The first one is the storage policy: you can change the rules for storing this specific resource such as only allowing it in specific storages or forbidding it totally.

#tuto_35_c1#1
Got it.--38--25

#tuto_35_c2#1
What happens when there's no room to store things ?--36

#tuto_35_c3#1
What is the "only in restricted" mode ?--37

#tuto_36_1#1
If there is no room available, resources will be placed directly on the floor where they will decay and eventually be lost unless quickly stored properly. 

#tuto_36_2#1
Extra resources on the ground will auto-relocate to any valid storage if free space becomes available.

#tuto_36_c1#1
Got it.--38--25

#tuto_36_c2#1
What is the "only in restricted" mode ?--37

#tuto_37_1#1
When you click on a storage building, you can set it to "restricted" and control what resources are allowed in it. 

#tuto_37_2#1
If you then set a resource storage policy to "only in restricted" in this menu, it will ONLY be allowed in storages that are in "restricted" mode AND that have been set to allow that specific resource. If there's no room the resources are destroyed.

#tuto_37_c1#1
Got it.--38--25

#tuto_37_c2#1
What happens when there's no room to store things ?--36

#tuto_38_1#1
The second one is the "Maintain stock" option: it allows you to ensure some of the produced resources will be saved to maintain a certain amount in stock, no matter what. Its really usefull to maintain stocks of foods for instance, regardless of the population's consumption.

#tuto_38_c1#1
Good to know!--39--26

#tuto_39_1#1
For now your only storage available is the "Ground storage": a free but inefficient storage of basic resources. It's just ground marked for storage of things. 

#tuto_39_2#1
Later on you will unlock proper storage buildings that can store much more on a smaller surface.

#tuto_39_c1#1
Very well.--40

#tuto_4_1#1
You start with a single group of units (a 'formation') that is the primitive tribe of nomads you currently control.  Click on it to select it.

#tuto_40_1#1
Not all resources can be stored anywhere: some specific categories of resources require specific storage types.

#tuto_40_2#1
For example, foods like meat or wheat can only be stored in granaries and livestocks require Paddocks. For now though, you do not have access to these buildings.

#tuto_40_c1#1
Ok.--41--27

#tuto_400_1#1
It looks like its the first time you ever discover the knowledge of "Barter"! 

#tuto_400_2#1
This allows you to enable the economic policy of "fair exchange". It's a milestone transition for your society that requires to explain a few new things...

#tuto_400_c1#1
Go on...--401

#tuto_401_1#1
By enabling "fair exchange", you will transition from a gift economy to a barter economy where people no longer freely share their commodities with each other while expecting later paybacks.

#tuto_401_c1#1
So what?--402

#tuto_402_1#1
Then, people will have properties and trade goods of equivalent value immediately. Your population will have incomes depending on their activites and they will also be able to increase their wealth level beyond 1 as a consequence.

#tuto_402_c1#1
Ok--403

#tuto_403_1#1
More importantly, while being in a gift economy your people can automatically access any of the available resources they want but this will no longer be the case once you enable "fair exchange".

#tuto_403_2#1
For people to access a resource, it will need to be distributed first and they'll have to purchase it.

#tuto_403_c1#1
How can I do that?--404

#tuto_403_c2#1
Very well. What then?--405

#tuto_404_1#1
There is 2 ways of doing this. The first one is with a new building, the merchant, that only does distribution. It will 'consume' one specific resource from the territory's stocks and make it available for the population to buy.

#tuto_404_2#1
The traders keep a share of the sales incomes while the rest goes to the original producers of the resource.

#tuto_404_c1#1
What's the other way?--405

#tuto_405_1#1
All production buildings also have access to a new type of annex: market stands. Like other annexes such as fields for farms, they're available from the production building's menu. 

#tuto_405_2#1
These annexes consume some of the building's workforce but they make the whole production of the building available for the people to buy. 

#tuto_405_c1#1
So what's the difference between the 2 methods?--406

#tuto_406_1#1
Market stands are free, consume workforce, and cannot distribute resource from stocks. They only sell their building's current productions.

#tuto_406_2#1
Merchants will sell any available resource -produced or stored- but they require one worker and they are not free to build. Also, they keep a share of all sales for themselves reducing the income of the producers.

#tuto_406_c1#1
Very well. What now?--407

#tuto_407_1#1
Once "fair exchange" is enabled, your population no longer has any access to any resource -including food- that is not 'distributed' by merchants or market stands. 

#tuto_407_2#1
It will be urgent that you start by making food (and then other resources such as pottery etc..) available to your people again by building merchants or setting up market stands with your production buildings.

#tuto_407_c1#1
Ok!--408

#tuto_407_c2#1
Wait... How can I do that again?--404

#tuto_408_1#1
Now, thanks to barter, your workers will now be much more efficient and your society more stable with less conflict allowing you to manage a bigger community with less risks of instability. 

#tuto_408_2#1
You'll also get to control if and how much you want to distribute each produced resource depending on your needs, which you can't do in a gift economy!

#tuto_408_c1#1
Good to know.--409

#tuto_409_1#1
Fair exchange enabling a primitive form of currency, you'll now also have to manage your government's treasury balance which is in charge of all the services global to the community such as the maintenance of common buildings, the village's palissades, or armies. These services require payments as well once you're not in a gift economy!

#tuto_409_c1#1
How do I fund all that?--410

#tuto_41_1#1
Now to the next mission : start producing some Wood.

#tuto_41_2#1
Wood, like Hammers, is an essential material used for many constructions. It is also consummed by many industrial buildings to craft other products.

#tuto_41_3#1
Place a woodcutter near a dense area of trees to start producing some.

#tuto_410_1#1
In these primitive times, the biggest source of income you can get is from your leader's own personnal funds by making them one and the same. 

#tuto_410_2#1
Using the "privileges" policy you can define the % of the territory's wealth awarded to your leader by right. This will slowly increase his personal wealth level which you can monitor in the territory menu by selecting the "Leader" population class.

#tuto_410_c1#1
Ok...--411

#tuto_411_1#1
Then, with the "Leadership" policy, you can assign how much of his personnal wealth you wish to assign to the government's expenses! 

#tuto_411_2#1
For example, a leader with a wealth of 20 contributing at 50% will therefore generate a treasury income of +10.

#tuto_411_c1#1
How else can I generate treasury income?--412

#tuto_412_1#1
This is likely to be your main source of income in these early ages. Besides that, your people will also willingly contribute to expenses for the community with up to 20% of their own incomes but its likely to remain marginal at first.

#tuto_412_2#1
Once you develop proper taxation, you'll be able to modify this percentage yourself!

#tuto_412_c1#1
Very well.--413

#tuto_413_1#1
That is all for now. Good luck in this difficult transition!

#tuto_413_c1#1
Thank you mister Sagacious Pig.--997

#tuto_414_1#1
Be careful, you made a mistake: this is not a Militia! Close this menu and retry, making sure to select the "militia" formation type this time!

#tuto_414_2#1
Unlike militias, other types will actually drain your population when recruiting, which is not what we want right now.

#tuto_415_1#1
That's unfortunate... Well nevermind, maybe you'll find one later on.

#tuto_415_c1#1
...

#tuto_42_1#1
Excellent. Now it's time to think about defending yourself: for that you will have to create a new "Formation" (a group of units).

#tuto_42_2#1
There is different types of formations. The best one to start defending yourself with is the "Militia".

#tuto_42_c1#1
Tell me more.--43

#tuto_43_1#1
In a "Militia" formation, it's units are not really recruited: it's the current population of the territory itself. Think of it as a stash of weapons kept ready for the population to take arms with when attacked.

#tuto_43_2#1
Therefore, it's units are not actually removed from your population and are "free", but the Militia cannot move to other territories and is purely defensive. Its perfect as basic defense.

#tuto_43_c1#1
Where do i create one ?--44--29

#tuto_44_1#1
This is the Units tab. In it you can see all the formations currently present in the territory. It's also where you can create new Formations.

#tuto_44_2#1
Click on the tab to open it.

#tuto_45_1#1
Now click the button to create a new Formation. Make sure to select the "militia" type and place the Formation's camp near your tribe.

#tuto_46_1#1
Very well. Now you have to recruit your first units into this new formation.

#tuto_46_2#1
There is different categories of units: civilian units are what you will use to create settling expeditions or transfering goods with carriers, but obviously not to defend youself. Open the "Ranged" tab.

#tuto_47_1#1
For now you only have access to a single ranged military unit: the rockthrower. A porco simply equiped with stones to throw, best used to defend behind walls and gates.

#tuto_47_2#1
Now, recruit at least 10 rockthrowers. Remember: as a "Militia", in fact you're not really recruiting them but merely storing equipment (here simple stones) for your population to use in case of attack.

#tuto_47_c1#1
What happens if i 'recruit' more militia that i have of population ?--48

#tuto_48_1#1
Then your militia will not be fully "manned" in case of attack: if you saved up equipment for 40 soldiers as your militia but only have 15 porcos in age to fight at the time of the attack in the territory, your Militia will only include 15 soldiers in the battle.

#tuto_48_c1#1
Got it.--47

#tuto_49_1#1
Congratulations: you now saved equipment for your population to use in case of attack. 

#tuto_49_2#1
Now, additionnaly to that, you can also organize the defensive strategy of your units using the "Strategic tool", such as defining the deployment positions of your new militia. Click to open it.

#tuto_5_1#1
On the bottom left is the formation menu of your formation. It shows details such as the list of units in this formation and their inventory. 

#tuto_5_2#1
Your tribe is currently camping in a territory with proper resources to start the game. This should be a safe place to establish your first settlement: on their formation menu, click the 'orders' button.

#tuto_50_1#1
With this tool, you can preview where all your troops ( militia or not ) will deploy in case of battle.

#tuto_50_2#1
You can select each troop and redeploy it where you want with the right click. Hold it to set their ranks and orientation.

#tuto_50_c1#1
Tell me more.--51--35

#tuto_51_1#1
You can set the behavior mode of each troop. By default they will move to engage any enemy that arrives.

#tuto_51_2#1
With a troop selected, you can click the dropdown button on the bottom left to select other modes that will affect that troop's behavior in battle.

#tuto_51_c1#1
Very well.--52--36

#tuto_52_1#1
Another tool is to create "Defensive zones" by clicking this button. Then click and drag on the terrain to set a point and a radius around it. 

#tuto_52_2#1
Once the zone is created, you can deploy troops in it and set them to the "defensive zone" behavior to have them defend this specific zone: they will be allowed to move out of it during battle.

#tuto_52_c1#1
Got it.--53--37

#tuto_53_1#1
Rockthrowers are only usefull in defense behind walls: I advise you to create a small fort of palissades and to then deploy them in it in 'stand ground' mode. This will protect you at least against invasion attempts.

#tuto_53_2#1
Once you are happy with your changes, make sure to close and SAVE your changes and let me know.

#tuto_53_c1#1
I'm done, let's move on!

#tuto_54_1#1
You now finished organizing your basic defenses. 

#tuto_54_2#1
In addition to potential events or conflicts with other players, nearby NPC 'barbarian' camps are likely to regularly spawn warbands that will attempt to raid, sack , or even invade your territories. 

#tuto_54_3#1
It won't be long before they notice you and send their first raiders, so you better be ready!

#tuto_54_c1#1
Good to know...--55--39

#tuto_55_1#1
It's time to address the topic of Knowledges (technologies), which unlock things like new buildings or new resources.

#tuto_55_2#1
To get new knowledges, you need to complete Projects. And to get Projects, you need to get Ideas. 

#tuto_55_c1#1
Go on...--56

#tuto_56_1#1
Ideas can come from your own population, spread from other territories, or be directly exchanged with other players via treaties.

#tuto_56_2#1
You cannot directly control when and what ideas your people will have. Each idea comes with it's own hidden conditions.

#tuto_56_c1#1
Ok.--57

#tuto_57_1#1
Now that your tribe is done setting camp in this territory, they got their first idea for Sedentarity, which will allow you to build your first proper dwellings.

#tuto_57_2#1
To actually get the 'knowledge' of Sendentarity, you will need to complete it's project first.

#tuto_57_c1#1
How do i do that ?--58--40

#tuto_58_1#1
This new button allows you to open another important menu : the Government Menu.

#tuto_58_2#1
That's where you can manage and monitor all global matters (non territory-specific ones) such as your treasury balance, your culture, your policies etc...

#tuto_58_3#1
Click to open it.

#tuto_59_1#1
The "Society" tab is where you manage your Policies, defining how your society is organized and works.

#tuto_59_2#1
For now, you are a primitive band society with a gift economy where everyone shares their goods. 

#tuto_59_c1#1
How do i change that ?--60

#tuto_6_1#1
Select the mission "Settle", leave all the options by default, and validate to order your whole tribe to settle in this territory. Its units and inventory will be unloaded in the territory which will now be under your control and the formation itself will disapear.

#tuto_60_1#1
Later, with new knowledges, you'll unlock new policies allowing your to evolve your society's political and economical organization.

#tuto_60_2#1
Now open the "Knowledges" tab to access your projects.

#tuto_61_1#1
This colum shows all the Knowledges your society currently has. It's empty for now.

#tuto_61_2#1
It also shows your knowledge capacity and current use. Each new knowledge costs some points depending on it's complexity. If your capacity is fully used, you will not be able to master new knowledges.

#tuto_61_c1#1
Ok.--63--43

#tuto_61_c2#1
How do i get knowledge capacity ?--62

#tuto_62_1#1
Your capacity is increased by your total culture. At start, your culture will be mostly produced by your total population so the more population you have, the more knowledge capacity.

#tuto_62_2#1
Later, with writting,  you'll also be able to build Libraries to manually increased your knowledge capacity.

#tuto_62_c1#1
Ok.--63--43

#tuto_63_1#1
The "Sedentary life" project will unlock the knowledge of "Sedentism". To start it you first need to assign "researchers" to the project, and each project requires a specific 'class' of researchers (here it's Farmers).

#tuto_63_2#1
Click the "+" button to assign researchers to the project.

#tuto_64_1#1
Be careful: assigning researchers reduces the productivity of all buildings employing the same population class as they are busy with the project instead of working.

#tuto_64_2#1
For instance, if you assign ALL your farmers to a project, then your farms will no longer produce anything.

#tuto_64_3#1
Select how many researchers you want to assign for the project and validate.

#tuto_65_1#1
Each researcher contributes 'research points' based on their intelligence.

#tuto_65_2#1
Each project also has a difficulty level, and the average intelligence of the assigned researchers define the odds of successfuly completing the project.

#tuto_65_c1#1
Ok.--66--46

#tuto_66_1#1
To start some projects you may also need to pay coins or resources. You will also need enough knowledge space to store the new knowledge it unlocks.

#tuto_66_2#1
You can now click to start the work on the project.

#tuto_67_1#1
Congratulations, you started your first project! It will take some time to complete it, depending on your number of researchers and their efficiency.

#tuto_67_c1#1
Very well.--111

#tuto_67_c2#1
What happens if a project fails ?--68

#tuto_68_1#1
If your project fails, you will have to restart it from scratch again. 

#tuto_68_2#1
You will have to repay all the starting requirements.

#tuto_68_c1#1
Damnit... So what now ?--111

#tuto_69_1#1
You now know all the minimum basics to start ruling and developing your tribe in Ymir and I only have a few things left to show you before i leave you.

#tuto_69_c1#1
It's about time!--70--48

#tuto_7_1#1
The territory selector shows the name of your  currently selected territory. On it's left is a round button that allows you to go into the territory.

#tuto_7_2#1
With your newly settled territory selected, click that button to go into your territory.

#tuto_70_1#1
This is your player score. Its based on different stats like your total wealth, culture, military power and knowledges.

#tuto_70_c1#1
Ok.--71--49

#tuto_71_1#2
Next to it are your Victory Points. At the end of every reward cycle, the players who meet the different victory conditions earn its associated Victory Point rewards.

#tuto_71_2#2
You win the game by beeing the first player to reach the objective of Victory Points set for that game (usually 100).

#tuto_71_c1#1
Good to know!--72--50

#tuto_71_c2#2
How long are reward cycles?--81

#tuto_72_1#1
Well that's it : my work here is now done and it's time for me to leave you in charge.

#tuto_72_c1#1
Thank you mister Pig.--999

#tuto_72_c2#1
Wait! What should i do now ?--73

#tuto_72_c3#1
I have some questions!--74

#tuto_73_1#1
Now that your tribe is settled, it's population should be slowly growing but this can take some time.

#tuto_73_2#1
In the meantime, it might be a good idea to keep exploring your surroundings in the worldmap and to locate herds to hunt down to provide your tribe with additional food to boost it's growth.

#tuto_73_c1#1
Ok.--74

#tuto_74_1#1
What do you want to know more about, young piglet ?

#tuto_74_c1#1
I have no more questions, mister Pig.--75

#tuto_74_c2#1
Can i see you again ?--76

#tuto_75_1#1
Farewell then, and good luck!

#tuto_75_c1#1
Goodbye!--999

#tuto_76_1#1
Yes i might popup from time to time when you unlock new important things!

#tuto_76_c1#1
Ok!--74

#tuto_77_1#1
You will have to create a new 'Formation' (your exploration expedition) and recruit units in it, then move it from the worldmap view.

#tuto_77_2#1
But be careful! This is dangerous, as every time you explore new territory tiles you may trigger 'exploration events': There is a lot to gain from them but also a lot to lose.

#tuto_77_c1#1
Ok.--78

#tuto_78_1#1
For your explorers to have any chance of success i strongly suggest you to recruit at least 10 warriors into your expedition party, for the world is dark and full of terrors.

#tuto_78_c1#1
Very well.--74

#tuto_79_1#1
Herds are finite groups of animals and not a permanent resource: they cannot be exploited by the Hunter building.

#tuto_79_2#1
To hunt them, you have to form a hunting party: Create a 'Formation' and recruit hunters (any warriors of your choice) as well as some carriers to transport the looted meat.

#tuto_79_c1#1
What then ?--80

#tuto_8_1#1
This is the territory you have settled and now control. In the middle of it is the camp your tribe has set with tents and with all their resources now unloaded onto the ground.

#tuto_8_c1#1
Very well.--9--7

#tuto_80_1#1
Move the hunters to the same territory as the herd in the worldmap and give them the order to "Hunt": it will initiate a battle where they will attempt to kill animals of the herd.

#tuto_80_2#1
Animals will fight back so be careful! Once the hunting is over and if successful, the formation will have fresh meat in it's inventory, which you can bring back to your tribe.

#tuto_80_c1#1
Excellent.--74

#tuto_81_1#2
The length of the reward cycles is dynamic: they become shorter as the game progresses or if the number of active players drops.

#tuto_81_c1#1
Fair enough.--72--50

#tuto_82_1#1
Are you sure? This tutorial can help you...

#tuto_82_c1#1
Yes--83

#tuto_83_1#1
Are you really sure ? I think it might be the best thing for you.

#tuto_83_c1#1
Yes!--84

#tuto_84_1#1
I think i know what is best for you, i'm going to stay here and go on with this tutorial. 

#tuto_84_c1#1
Please go away...--1

#tuto_84_c2#1
What can i do to make you leave me alone ?--85

#tuto_85_1#1
Bears.

#tuto_85_c1#1
What ?--86

#tuto_86_1#1
I have bears.

#tuto_86_c1#1
Bears ? What does that have to do with anything ?--87

#tuto_87_1#1
It will, if you don't go on with my tutorial.

#tuto_87_c1#1
You're a Bear summoning tutorial assistant ?--88

#tuto_87_c2#1
I don't see any bears. Where are they ?--98

#tuto_88_1#1
Yes.

#tuto_88_c1#1
And what will your bears do if i don't follow your tutorial ?--89

#tuto_89_1#1
My bears are trained to do many things, including devouring the entrails of your tribespigs.

#tuto_89_c1#1
I don't care, i can get another tribe.--90

#tuto_9_1#1
You have now completed your first mission and unlocked it's rewards.

#tuto_9_2#1
Your next mission is now to provide fresh water for your tribe.

#tuto_9_c1#1
I am thrilled by the complexity of these missions, lets get on with it!--10

#tuto_90_1#1
You're not a really good leader for your people.

#tuto_90_c1#1
You're not a really good tutorial assistant.--91

#tuto_91_1#1
You're mean.

#tuto_91_c1#1
Will you leave me alone now ?--92

#tuto_92_1#1
Fine. Have fun with this shitty game: Its UIs and menus are so bad you're never gonna figure it out by yourself anyways. I'm too old for this shit...

#tuto_92_c1#1
Yes, FINE! I don't need you!--999

#tuto_92_c2#1
Wait what ?--93

#tuto_93_1#1
No it's too late. Ha! I bet you won't even find how to settle your tribe, the buttons have been visciously hidden... Goodbye... Piglet!

#tuto_93_c1#1
No! Don't leave, i changed my mind!--94

#tuto_93_c2#1
I'll take my chances, if it means getting passed this lousy tutorial.--999

#tuto_94_1#1
That's not gonna be enough. I demand apologies.

#tuto_94_c1#1
I'm sorry.--95

#tuto_95_1#1
I'm sorry who ?

#tuto_95_c1#1
I'm sorry, mister Sagacious Pig.--96

#tuto_96_1#1
It's MISTER mister Sagacious pig to you.

#tuto_96_c1#1
I'm sorry, mister mister Sagacious Pig. Can we get back at it now?--97

#tuto_97_1#1
Hmmmph... That will do, pig... that will do. You better be listening and nice this time!

#tuto_97_c1#1
I'm listening.--1

#tuto_98_1#1
They're hiding. Bears hibernate.

#tuto_98_c1#1
You're bluffing.--99

#tuto_98_c2#1
We're not even in winter. Bears only hibernate in winter.--104

#tuto_99_1#1
I have an army of bears! I can summon them all and wipe your insolent tribe off this world!

#tuto_99_c1#1
No you don't. You're just a lame tutorial assistant trying to be funny.--100

#tuto_char_1#1
This is where you create your character. You can design and name it, as well as your government's name and flag. 

#tuto_char_2#1
You have to choose among a list of different starting types, the default one for a new game being the "primitive tribe".

#tuto_char_3#1
In multiplayer, you may as well specify the name of a friend's character to spawn as close to him as possibe but to do so you will need his 'Invite code' as well.

#tuto_char_4#1
Be careful: once you create a character -especially in persistent multiplayer games- you are not allowed to recreate a new one right away if you mess up! You will have to wait for a period of up to several days before you're allowed to try again in that same game. 

#tuto_create_1#1
This is where you setup and start a new game. There is 2 main game modes: persistent and realtime. If you're playing alone or with a few friends, its best to leave it to 'realtime'.

#tuto_join_1#1
This is where you join existing games. 

#tuto_join_2#1
If you need to rejoin your own local game, go to "Direct IP" and connect to "localhost" port 14804. 

#tuto_join_3#1
If you want to join multiplayer games you have the choice between persistent (24/7 games that last months) and realtime games (faster games to play with friends).

#tuto_launch_1#1
Welcome to Ymir! It looks like it's the first time you're launching this game. 

#tuto_launch_2#1
This is a complex game: if you're not familiar with it yet, it's strongly advised to start by completing the beginner's tutorial in a solo game to learn the basics. However if you already know the game, you can choose to disable all tutorials right now.

#tuto_lnchgame_1#1
You are starting your first own game! This is a client-server game: even if you are playing solo, starting a new game will auto-launch a separated server and auto-connect you to it. For others to be able to join this game, you MUST make sure to forward the port used by your server properly (14804 by default). If the server auto-launch fails, you will have to manually start the server from the game folder using server.bat, and then connect to it with "join game".

#tuto_persist_1#1
You have joined your first peristent multiplayer game! In this game mode, things go MUCH slower than in realtime mode, and be careful: no room for mistakes here! You have to deal with whatever start you've been given and second chances are expensive as you will have to wait days before being able to retry with a new character if you lose this one.

#tuto_warnjoin_1#1
You have not completed the starting tutorial yet: It is strongly advised to do so before attempting to join any persistent multiplayer game.

#tuto_warnjoin_2#1
Multiplayer persistent games are unforgiving! Starting conditions can be much more complex, and if you fail you will not be allowed to immediately restart a new character as respawning is limited by a period of cool off up to several days. Learn the basics first so you don't mess up right away and lose you chance!
