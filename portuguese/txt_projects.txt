#idea_ptry
The mud baskets

#idea_ptry1_1
A piglet playing in the mud noticed a special type of maleable mud that dried under the sun and started playing with it. His mother is a basket crafter for the tribe. Unfortunately, her baskets are not the finest ones there is, and gatherers often complain about their crude weaving: cereals often slip through and rats manage to steal the rest.

#idea_ptry1_2
Upon seeing her mud covered son coming back, she had the idea to cover one of her baskets with it and let it dry in a sunny afternoon, making it more hermetic and putting an end to the gatherers' critics.

#idea_ptry1_3
Unfortunately, the basket didnt last long and the mud quickly cracked and fell from the basket's frame. She would like to request the help of a few tribespigs to go collect more of this mud and time to try make more of these special baskets. Near the tribe's bondfire at nights, its often hotter than a sunny summer afternoon: she thinks that we should try placing the special mud near a very big fire to make it dry faster and harder.

#proj_ptry1_1
Let's try to make baskets of mud, and to find out how to dry them properly so that they don't crumble away in a few days.

#proj_ptry1_2
These baskets could be much easier and faster to make. More hermetic than the woven ones, it would help the tribe store things!

#proj_ptry1_3
We need some tribespigs to gather some of this special mud and learn how to shape it in baskets and how to put them in fire so it hardens.

#idea_sedent
Sedentary life

#idea_sedent_1
On one evening by the tribe's camp fire, Grooeky Lazysnout spoke in these words: 

#idea_sedent_2
<< We have everything we need here! What if we stopped moving around like the ancients, and stayed for good in this territory ? I am tired of mounting and dismounting these tents every day! By staying in the same place we could accumulate more tools and more things without having to worry about carrying them! >>

#proj_sedent_1
What if we decided to settle for good an remain in the same territory ? We could cumulate more things and more tools by not having to worry about having enough tribe's pigs to carry everything everytime we move!

#idea_prprt
This is mine

#idea_prprt_1
The tribe is now growing bigger and, since we decided to settle down, we now have many objects and tools: much more than what the ancients used to have in their nomadic lives! But a strange thing is happening as this abundance of things seems to be creating tensions amongst us. Some porcos who spent a lot of time crafting things resent having to share them with others they dont feel are doing as much as them. 

#idea_prprt_2
One Porco is proposing that we all agree not to take things from another family without their permission. A strange concept... but these are strange times. 

#proj_prprt_1
Many people of the tribe are resenting having to share all their things with each other and its creating tensions. 

#proj_prprt_2
To solve these conflicts, we could try to convince all the families of the tribe to accept this simple rule: members of one family are no longer allowed to take things from another family without their approval.

#idea_eldcncl
Solving conflicts

#idea_eldcncl_1
Everyone in the tribe knows Schnappy Schnapps, the eldest son of the Porker family. Dumb as a rock and good for nothing... but no one can deny the magnifiscence of his long boar tusks. It wasnt long before Yertruden, the youngest Sow of the Truitus family, fell to his charms, which greatly upsetted his father who refused this union despite the gifts offered by the Porker elders. 

#idea_eldcncl_2
Tensions rose and conflict threatened the unity of the tribe. What if Porcos that have nothing to do with the conflict where chosen by the tribe to decide how to settle this situation ? 

#proj_eldcncl_1
A lot of conflicts could be avoided if the elders of each family of the tribe talked with each other more often, for the oldpigs are wise and have the respect of their families. Also it would give them something to do besides pestering the youngsters of the tribe...

#proj_eldcncl_2
If we can convince them to talk to each other, which will not be easy, we could build a special large hut for them to meet and talk about issues of the tribe. I am sure the rest of the tribe would abide to their judgements and decisions.

#idea_privl
I deserve retribution!

#idea_privl_1
The tribe is growing and as its dominant leader you now spend a lot of your time managing things and discussing matters of the tribe, with less and less time to participate in lower tasks and work like any other tribespig.

#idea_privl_2
And what would the tribe become without your benevolent work ? Don't you deserve to be rewarded and assisted for your hard work ? And how can you earn the respect of the tribe if you just appear to be their equal ? Then some will always try to contest your legitimacy as a ruler!

#proj_privl_1
Displaying wealth would be a good way to impress and gain dominance on possible rivals, showing  to everyone that you are fit to rule them because you are not like anyone else: you are their superior. 

#proj_privl_2
Yes, they should all aknowledge your superiority by giving  you a share of their wealth! Now though, the rest of the tribe remains to be convinced of this groundbreaking concept...

#idea_lead
One Porco to rule them all

#idea_lead_1
All these talks to try convincing everyone of the tribe to do anything are just taking too long. Too much talking, too much negociating, too much time wasted. Some are more worthy to rule than others, anyways... And it should be you, of course, you just know it! All you could do if you weren't slowed down by having to convince everyone else every time... It was fine before, but now the village has grown and there's just too many people. 

#proj_lead_1
Its time for the tribe to be lead by a single Porco. One pig to rule them all, without all the talking and negociating and convincing everyone to do anything. But this will not be easy, and all the other key members of the village must give their support, be submitted or be eliminated. Then, finally, only you will control the fate of the tribe!

#idea_gov
Organizing the power

#idea_gov_1
We are no longer a small tribe: our society has grown more and more complex, with always more people and more things to manage and maintain... While a single leader can no longer attend to all the issues and matters that require attention and know all the skills, on the other hand projects that affect the whole society such as maintaining expensive common structures  cannot be dealt with by independent individuals on their own and require a common organization.

#idea_gov_2
Maybe its time to reorganize and formalize the leadership of our people, and to learn how to delegate tasks to better manage everything: what if we created a new kind of class of Porcos assisting the leader, with officialy as their only occupation to manage issues in his name ?

#proj_gov_1
We could reorganize the leadership of our society by having new delegates with an official status, acting under the instructions and mandate of our leader: a hierarchy of porcos responsible of different aspects of our society, instead of having the leader personnaly attend to all issues.

#proj_gov_2
They could all work in a single big impressive building in the middle of our village made for this sole purpose, to reinforce your legitimacy. With this, we would be able to manage much more easily our growing society and people.

#idea_guard
Guards

#idea_guard_1
Who is going to ensure everyone pays their due ? Who is going to go shake the sows and piglets so that a stubborn Porco reveals the precious wares he was hidding burried under his hut's floor and refusing to pay as tribute to your highness ? 

#idea_guard_2
Surely the officials of the government shouldnt belittle themselves in doing such tasks. Plus most of them are not exactly in shape to impress hardened peasants... However what if we used some of these tributes to pay strong Porcos of to escort the officials and do the dirty work? The people would think twice before contesting our authority!

#proj_guard_1
Lets create and organize a new cast directly dependent on the goverment: guards, a new kind of warriors that would protect the government not against foreign ennemies but against our own population. They would protect officals and patrol the city everyday, reinforcing our authority on the population. 

#idea_tribut
Tributes

#idea_tribut_1
Instead of relying on voluntary contributions from the people, its time to set rules and force everyone to give their share for the common good of everyone... to us in the government of course.

#idea_barter
No more free meals!

#idea_barter_1
We could start exchanging goods of equivalent values for each service on the instant instead of sharing everything with anyone of the community hoping for later paybacks which becomes harder to track as the population increases: a gift economy can only be viable as long as all members of the community can build trust by knowing and remembering each other. Beyond that it creates much conflict and instability which could be reduced by transitionning to a system of immediate equivalent exchange.

We could try to select common goods that are small, durable and rare enough to use as standards for exchanges: anyone could exchange their goods to one of these knowing they can then trade it back against other necessities. That would facilitate trading, not having to find goods needed by both parties and beeing able to measure and store values more efficiently.

#idea_calculus_1
Algebra and Geometry have been coexisting for ever, but are not well linked. We have no way of harnessing the analytical power of algebra to describe geometry. 

#idea_calculus_2
But one of our Academicians, René Despigs, had this revolutionnary idea: what if we connected them both by describing positions on a plane using a pair of numbers associated with a horizontal axis and a vertical axis? By describing the horizontal measurement with x's and the vertical measurement with y's, we could give geometric objects such as lines and circles representation as algebraic equations.

#idea_fineryforg
Working with cast iron

#idea_fineryforg_1
Iron is a capricious metal hard to work with. If you heat it just enough to soften, with a lot of manual forging you can work it into a maleable but flexible soft metal. However if you melt it completely to the point of casting it, it becomes very hard but brittle and impossible to work with! Blast furnaces are very efficient and fast but they are so efficient they only produce this cast iron we do not know how to work with properly... Heating and hammering it for a long time allows to slowly remove the carbon, eventually producing pure 'rough iron'. Using our knowledges of mechanics, we could try to create special forges making this operation much more faster and efficient, allowing us to streamline iron production out of cast iron ingots we can already mass produce with bast furnaces.

#idea_decarb_1
Cast Iron isn't really usefull by itself: it's very strong but also very brittle and you cannot work with it. We can produce it easily but its saturated with carbon... Meanwhile, steel is also iron, but with less carbon in it. Currenlty we are making steel by taking pure iron and adding carbon to it with charcoal but its slower to produce and requires a lot of manual forging to produce while Cast Iron can be mass produced with blast furnaces. Therefore it would make steel production much easier if we could master a way to make steel out of Cast Iron by removing the extra carbon instead of making it by adding carbon to pure iron.

"If we cannot find enough plants to feed everyone anymore, then let us make our own!" he said.

#idea_charcoal
A new combustible

#idea_charcoal_1
Sometimes when burning wood, after a large fire, some pieces of wood burn but didnt turn into ashes. They look grey and porous, and after trying to light a new fire with them they appear to burn even hotter than normal wood while producing little smoke and are easier to light. If we could figure out exactly how to make these out of wood, we could use them in our pottery kilns and other industries instead of wood, increasing their efficiency!

Sometimes peeling tree barks or long grass gives you long strips of vegetables that can be dried and woven into baskets and other things by the craftmen of the tribe. But these are usually hard and rough. Yet some of them compete to always produce the finest weaving with the softest thread, experimenting with new techniques and new materials. What if they managed to make a material thin, flexible and light enough to use instead of the smelly leather hides we use for clothing?

#idea_loom5_1
The 'shuttle' is a piece of the loom that needs to go from one side of the textile to the other constantly. Its a fastidious and tiring operation for the weaver, requiring to constantly bend over the machine to move the shuttle, and it limits the size of the woven textile to his arm's lenght or it requires complex coordination between multiple workers. If we could find a way to improve this process with mechanics, it could greatly improve the productivity of our textile industries and the working conditions of our weavers.

Animal hides are smelly and they decay, harden, and rot pretty quickly. We need to find ways to improve their durability by preventing their putrefaction. To do that we should master the proper way to clean and process the hides: removing hair, scrapping all the leftover flesh, and drying them with smoke and sun in the same way we smoke meat to make it last longer.

Removing the hair out of the hides is a really labor intensive process that requires a lot of time but is necessary to process the hides into more durable leather. But some tanners with questionnable hobbies advanced that by using urine and soaking the hides for a long time in it makes the hair removing much easier afterwards. This nasty process could greatly improve the efficiency of our tanneries, but its definilty not going to improve the problem of their pestilence...

Using tannins

#idea_vegettan_1
One autumn, a busy and inexperienced tanner had left and forgotten a stack of cleaned hides outside near his house, under a grove of trees. The hides remained there for weeks and hadn't been properly packed: they soaked with water from the humid ground and constant rains of autumn, covered and surrounded by fallen twigs and leaves from the nearby trees. When the tanner realized his mistake, he was quite surprised to find the hides in such good condition: not only had they resisted putrefaction from the humidity, but they looked more flexible than the ones usually processed through drying and smoking. What was the cause of this miracle? Looking at the brown water from the decaying leaves and wood in which the hides had soaked all that time, the tanner felt he already knew the answer to that.

#proj_vegettan_1
It seems that by soaking hides for a long time in baths of diluted vegetables and wood, we could improve their flexibility and resistance to humidity, increasing their durability and replacing the older less efficient process of letting them rot and smoking them.

We could use floaters one one edge and weights on the opposite one so it would stand vertically in the water and catch all the bigger fishes trying to pass through!

One day, a Porco left a few leftover grains in a pot outside of his hut. Forgotten, they remained there for days under the rain. Later, while cleaning stuff around his hut, the Porco happened to cover the pot by stacking other baskets on top of it without noticing its content. When he eventually rediscovered the pot, from its content came a strange somewhat appealing smell. Curious by nature, the hog tasted the drink and felt funny afterwards.

As enemies now face us with armors stronger than ever made of hardened steel, blades tend to ricochet on their surface. We need a new weapon able to deliver blows with full force that no metallic armor would be able to withstand: some weaponsmiths propose to create thin hammers mounted on long poles that could inflict damage even without piercing the armor itself but simply by the force of impact!

Improving spears

#idea_helbard_1
Some weaponsmiths proposed to build a new versatile pole weapon combining the features of spears and battleaxes into one. With its high reach it could be efficient against other pikes and spears infantry but also against mounted units while beeing also able to cut and slash with its side blade.

Countering blows

#idea_shield_1
To protect ourselves in hand to hand combat or against enemies throwing javelins, arrows, we could try to craft light armors of wood and strong leather that soldiers would carry on one arm to counter blows.

#idea_metshield
Improving shields

#idea_metshield_1
We could produce stronger but heavier shields by adding a metal sheet on their surface on top of wood, if we can master the proper way to do this.

#idea_hvshield
Bigger shields

#idea_hvshield_1
What if we made shields larger and tall enough to stand directly on the ground and wide enough for the soldier to be fully protected behind it? It would allow units to withstand heavy charges by taking support on the shields. These heavy items would however slow down troops and limit their movements, reducing their combat skill.

Updating shields

#idea_stlshld_1
Steel is stronger, lighter and more flexible than any other metals we've ever had. We could use it to improve our shields for our elite units, combining lightweightness and resistance by reinforcing wood and leather with a thin sheet of steel.

#idea_paddarm
Wearable mattresses

#idea_paddarm_1
Leather is well resistant to cutting, but not really efficient in cushionning blows. Some artisans propose to create a thicker type of armor designed to cushion enemy blows by using cotton and 'quilting': sewing several layers of fabric together. They claim such armor, even by itself, could prove far more efficient than expected while only using cheap materials. It could also be used in addition to other types of armor worn above it.

#idea_scalearm
Clothes of metal

#idea_scalearm_1
Metal is hard and resistent. What if our warrior could wear clothes made of metal to resist enemy blows? Unfortunately its not exactly flexible like cloth... What if, like the scales of the fish, we made a metallic skin made of small scales covering each other, still allowing its wearer to move while beeing heavily protected?

#idea_brigdn
A coat of plates

#idea_brigdn_1
Scale armors are vulnerable to piercing attacks and upward blows. Despite a slight loss of flexibility, what if instead of having visible scales on top of each other we designed an armor where the scales are sewn indepently to a padded leather cloth and covered by another layer of fabric to hide them, making the whole more resistant to piercing thanks to the leather and the impossibility to slip the point of a weaping through gaps between scales?

#idea_chnmail
Unpiercable coat

#idea_chnmail_1
All armors remain weak against piercing blows: the finest weaponsmiths propose to craft a fine cloth of tiny metal rings which, linked together, would form an unpiercable coat that could be worn beneath other armors to protect against arrows and thrusting attacks. Such an armor would be expensive and really time consuming, requiring the best craftsmanship and metal, probably reserved to elite troops.

#idea_cuirass
Wearing plates of hard metal

#idea_cuirass_1
A warrior with a skin of metal would be undefeatable for sure. And metal can be shaped into anything we want. However its not flexible... But we could still use it as a breastplate protecting most of the body from enemy weapons, although it would be heavy and reduce the dexterity of the warrior wearing it, it could save his life more than once!

Metallic hats

#idea_lhelmet_1
Most fatal blows for warriors are to the head. With our new knowledge of metallurgy we can shape something solid into anything we want. We should make hats made of hard metal, that would greatly improve the protection of our warriors.

#idea_hvhelmet_1
Why not cover the whole face and sides with metal as well with our helmets? Sure it would reduce the field of vision for our warriors, but it would look sick. It would also improve their armor too...

#idea_elephrid
The sow and the elephant

#idea_elephrid_1
In one small paddock was kept an elephant, a mighty beast captured from the wilderness and now kept in captivity as livestock or maybe just by curiosity. Most people were afraid to approach but every day a lonely young sow would go to the beast to feed him with fresh vegetables, fascinated by its magesty. To her the animal didn't look feriocious: she saw intelligence and sadness in its eyes. As time passed, she built trust with the elephant who would wait for her and greet her with her trunk when she arrived.

#idea_elephrid_2
One night, she decided to free the elephant from its paddock: the animal fled and the sow felt happy. Months passed and the turmoils of this event faded... Later, as she was wandering in the woods after a heavy storm, she fell into a mud hole and got stuck under a fallen tree trunk. For many hours she called for help. But noone ever came... not even the elephant which, unbeknownst to all, was in fact lying dead in a ditch not far away after getting stuck in a mud hole as well. But this tragic story gave another porco some thoughs: first that mud holes are dangerous. And then that surely if an elephant had happened to be there he could have easily pulled that trunk to save the sow... if only the one they had hadn't escaped a few weeks before!

Taming pachyderms

#proj_elephrid_1
These huge pachyderm beasts have the strenght of 50 hogs. They also seem to be pretty clever: what if we could find a way to tame them and work with them? Imagine the rampage such mighty animals could do into battles if they accepted to fight among us! They surely look strong enough to carry and push heavy weights. Maybe they could even carry people on their backs... It's worth trying!

#idea_obsidn
Shiny black stones

#idea_obsidn_1
The weaponmakers of the tribe noticed that this special shiny black stone called obsidian is much better than regular flint: when broken, it is sharper than anything they've ever seen and it can cut through anything. What if we tried to make deadly weapons out of it? Now the stones are usually small, but one craftpig had this idea: what if we inserted several of them into wooden poles to create a longer continuous blade in the shape that we want? 

#proj_obsidn_1
Obsidian is volcanic glass that is easy to work and very hard: it can break into extremely sharp angles which could be turned into weapons sharper than anything made out of regular flints. We could invest time and resources to have people of the tribe master the skill of working it and to design weapons out of it.

#idea_beastwr
The way of the beasts

#idea_beastwr_1
Some wild animals are fierce and noble. Their hunting ways deserve respect and admiration of our warriors. The spirits of these magestic beasts could infuse strenght in our best porcos to form an elite cast of warriors that would instill fear onto our enemies.
