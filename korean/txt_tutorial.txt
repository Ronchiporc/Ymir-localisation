#tuto_launch_1
Ymir 의 세계에 오신 것을 환영합니다! 당신은 게임을 처음 플레이하시는 것 같군요. 

#tuto_launch_2
이 게임은 복잡합니다. 아직 게임에 익숙하지않으시다면, 기본적인 것을 배우기 위해 싱글플레이에서 초보자를 위한 튜토리얼을 완료할 것을 추천드립니다. 벌써 게임플레이 하는 법을 알고 계시다면, 지금 튜토리얼을 끄셔도 됩니다.

#tuto_create_1
여기서 게임을 설정하고 게임을 시작합니다. 2가지의 게임모드가 있는 데, 영구모드와 리얼타임드가 있습니다. 만약 혼자 플레이하시거나 몇명의 친구와 게임한다면, 리얼타임모드로 하시면 됩니다.

#tuto_lnchgame_1
첫번째 게임을 시작하시고 계시군요! 클라이언트 서버 게임입니다. 혼자하시더라도, 분리된 서버가 자동으로 실행되고 자동으로 연결됩니다. 다른 플레이어가 접속할 수 있게 하시려면 14804로 포트포워딩을 꼭 하셔야합니다. 만약 자동으로 서버가 열리지않을 시, 게임폴더에서  server.bat 파일로 실행해주신 후 Join Game 을 통해 접속하시기바랍니다.

#tuto_char_1
This is where you create your character. You can design and name it, as well as your government's name and flag. 

#tuto_char_2
You have to choose among a list of different starting types, the default one for a new game being the "primitive tribe".

#tuto_char_3
In multiplayer, you may as well specify the name of a friend's character to spawn as close to him as possibe but to do so you will need his 'Invite code' as well.

#tuto_char_4
Be careful: once you create a character -especially in persistent multiplayer games- you are not allowed to recreate a new one right away if you mess up! You will have to wait for a period of up to several days before you're allowed to try again in that same game. 

#tuto_warnjoin_1
You have not completed the starting tutorial yet: It is strongly advised to do so before attempting to join any persistent multiplayer game.

#tuto_warnjoin_2
Multiplayer persistent games are unforgiving! Starting conditions can be much more complex, and if you fail you will not be allowed to immediately restart a new character as respawning is limited by a period of cool off up to several days. Learn the basics first so you don't mess up right away and lose you chance!

#tuto_join_1
This is where you join existing games. 

#tuto_join_2
If you need to rejoin your own local game, go to "Direct IP" and connect to "localhost" port 14804. 

#tuto_join_3
If you want to join multiplayer games you have the choice between persistent (24/7 games that last months) and realtime games (faster games to play with friends).

#tuto_persist_1
You have joined your first peristent multiplayer game! In this game mode, things go MUCH slower than in realtime mode, and be careful: no room for mistakes here! You have to deal with whatever start you've been given and second chances are expensive as you will have to wait days before being able to retry with a new character if you lose this one.

#tuto_0_1
Greetings newpig! I am Sagacious Pig your tutorial assistant. 

#tuto_0_2
I'm here to guide you through the first steps of the game and explain how things work.

#tuto_0_c1
Tell me more!--1

#tuto_0_c2
I wanted to do the tutorial but now that i see your ugly face i'd rather skip it.--82

#tuto_1_1
You are currently in the world map. Each tile is a 'territory' you can explore and colonize. 

#tuto_1_2
At the start, most of the map is unexplored except the few territories around your tribe.

#tuto_1_c1
Very well... so what now ?--2--1

#tuto_2_1
This is a mission event. You will sometimes get missions you can complete to unlock rewards. Here, your first task is simply to settle your tribe in your first territory.

#tuto_2_c1
Yes... yes... Let us begin then!--3--2

#tuto_3_1
Events will appear  as flags on top of the screen and you can also review them all by clicking this button next to the flags.

#tuto_3_c1
Thank you mister Pig, shall we continue ?--4--3

#tuto_4_1
You start with a single group of units (a 'formation') that is the primitive tribe of nomads you currently control.  Clic on it to select it.

#tuto_5_1
On the bottom left is the formation menu of your formation. It shows details such as the list of units in this formation and their inventory. 

#tuto_5_2
Your tribe is currently camping in a territory with proper resources to start the game. This should be a safe place to establish your first settlement: on their formation menu, clic the 'orders' button.

#tuto_6_1
Select the mission "Settle", leave all the options by default, and validate to order your whole tribe to settle in this territory. Its units and inventory will be unloaded in the territory which will now be under your control and the formation itself will disapear.

#tuto_7_1
The territory selector shows the name of your  currently selected territory. On it's left is a round button that allows you to go into the territory.

#tuto_7_2
With your newly settled territory selected, clic that button to go into your territory.

#tuto_8_1
This is the territory you have settled and now control. In the middle of it is the camp your tribe has set with tents and with all their resources now unloaded onto the ground.

#tuto_8_c1
Very well.--9--7

#tuto_9_1
You have now completed your first mission and unlocked it's rewards.

#tuto_9_2
Your next mission is now to provide fresh water for your tribe.

#tuto_9_c1
I am thrilled by the complexity of these missions, lets get on with it!--10

#tuto_10_1
To sustain themselves, your porcos need food and water or they will quickly die. They were carrying a bit of food with them, but no water : the first urgent thing to do is to setup a water collection point on the shore a fresh water point.

#tuto_10_c1
How do i do that ?--11--8

#tuto_11_1
This is the building tab of the territory, where you can see all your currently available buildings and order their construction in this territory.

#tuto_11_2
In the first "housing" building tab, select the "Water collector" building. 

#tuto_12_1
This building is free and does not require any workers: it simply represents a spot on the shore cleared and levelled to allow your porcos easy access to fresh water: they will get it themselves as they need it. Try to place it next to tiles of water:  it needs to have one edge adjascent to water to work.

#tuto_13_1
Now that your porcos need for water is satisifed, they need sustainable sources of food as their stocks will run out soon. 

#tuto_13_c1
Food please!--14--10

#tuto_14_1
There is 2 kinds of natural sources of foods : edible plants and spots of wild animals. The first one can be exploited by the Farm building and the latter by the Hunter.

#tuto_14_2
Farms and Hunters are buildings that exploit natural resources. They need to be placed near valid resources. Now, start by trying to place a hunter.

#tuto_15_1
When you are placing a building that exploits natural resources, an area of tiles appears highlighted around it: it's the production range of the building.  

#tuto_15_2
Grey and Red tiles means there's nothing exploitable: you need to look fot the tiles that are highlighted in GREEN, indicating a valid exploitable resource for the building.

#tuto_15_3
Scan the territory with the building selected to look for a valid spot to place it.

#tuto_15_c1
How do i recognize exploitable animals ?--16

#tuto_15_c2
How do i recognize edible plants ?--18

#tuto_16_1
A natural spot of wild animals is a single tile that will appear green when placing a Hunter. It has a few visible animals walking wandering around it. One hunter is enough as it's only a single tile.

#tuto_16_c1
Got it.--15

#tuto_16_c2
I see animals but the Hunter doesnt seem to be able to exploit them.--17

#tuto_17_1
Sometimes animals are present in a territory as a 'herd'. Herds are depletable and temporary groups of animals and they cannot be hunted in a permanent and sustainable way through a Hunter building: you will need to manually hunt them with units. Ignore them for now.

#tuto_17_c1
Very well...--15

#tuto_18_1
Spots of edible plants are usually large patches of similar looking plants or trees. If the patch is large, you may place several Farms around it to fully exploit it.

#tuto_18_c1
Very well.--15

#tuto_19_1
You have now started satisfying the 2 urgent needs of your tribe of water and food. These 2 needs combined form something called the "Vital needs".

#tuto_19_2
When the Vital needs are not fully satisfied, it means some of your Porcos are suffering from malnutrition and dying.

#tuto_19_c1
Good to know.--20--13

#tuto_20_1
This button opens an important menu: the "Territory menu". 

#tuto_20_2
It shows everything you need to know about the territory you are in, allowing you to check it's situation and to diagnose it's problems. Clic to open it.

#tuto_21_1
This menu has a lot of informations combined in it. The top half is a global summary of the territory with all it's important stats in a single space.

#tuto_21_2
The lower half of the menu is a set of tabs, each one giving you more in-depth details about a specific territory stat: economy, growth, administration...

#tuto_21_c1
Ok!--22

#tuto_22_1
This is the important part to look for now : the global vital needs of your populaiton that i mentionned earlier. 

#tuto_22_2
It needs to remains more or less above 70%: meaning most people in your tribe have enough food and water not to starve to death. It's an important value you will always have to monitor.

#tuto_22_c1
Very well.--23--15

#tuto_23_1
Just below it is the territory's Growth: the current variation of your population. This is what you will be looking for the most in early game.

#tuto_23_2
Positive growth means your population is increasing and you will get new active Porcos you can employ in buildings. 

#tuto_23_3
Satisfied Vital Needs is essential to maintain a positive growth, but it's not the only factor influencing it.

#tuto_23_c1
Got it.--26--16

#tuto_23_c2
What are the factors influencing Growth?--24

#tuto_23_c3
How do I improve Growth?--25

#tuto_24_1
You can clic on the "Growth" tab to access details about the global Growth of your population. Growth is the result of 2 main factors: the will of population to have children and their survival. 

#tuto_24_2
The will to have children is detailed in the right side column and is affected mostly by the Life Quality of the population.

#tuto_24_3
The survival of piglets into adulthood is affected mostly by the global Health of your population.

#tuto_24_c1
Got it.--26--16

#tuto_24_c2
So how do I improve it?--25

#tuto_25_1
First make sure your Vital Needs are satisfied. Then you will want to improve global Health and Life Quality as much as possible.

#tuto_25_2
Provide good dwellings for your population, diversified food and generally try to fill the maximum of your population's needs!

#tuto_25_c1
Got it.--26--16

#tuto_26_1
This is your current population. It's divided into groups of "Social Classes", each one represented by one button.

#tuto_26_2
"Inactives" is the default class of currently jobless adult Porcos available to work in new buildings. Once a porco starts working in a building, he converts to the social class the building employs.

#tuto_26_c1
Understood. Now what ?--27

#tuto_27_1
Before building new production buildings, you will want to check that you have enough inactives to work in them.

#tuto_27_2
You should still have a decent amount of Inactive Porcos available: let's keep them busy and move on the next mission!

#tuto_27_c1
I'm ready.--28--17

#tuto_28_1
Building things require resources and one of the most commonly required one at first is Hammers, made from Flints.

#tuto_28_2
You must now produce your first Hammers as your stocks will soon run out as you build. 

#tuto_28_c1
Ok.--29--18

#tuto_29_1
Hammers will be your first 'industrial product': a resource that is crafted from other resources.

#tuto_29_2
Hammers require flints -a natural resource- which you can produce with the Flint collector.

#tuto_29_3
Start by building a Flint collector in a valid location, near any gravely looking ground tiles.

#tuto_30_1
Very well! Now you can build the Tool maker.

#tuto_30_2
Unlike natural producers, industries can be placed anywhere for they do not exploit any natural resource: they combine existing ones.

#tuto_31_1
Great, you are now producing your first Hammers!

#tuto_31_2
Hammers are your first type of tool. Later, you will unlock new tools which will also be required by many constructions.

#tuto_31_3
Unlike resources like foods, tools are not consummed by the population to satisfy their needs: it's player-used only.

#tuto_31_c1
Ok.--32--21

#tuto_32_1
This is the resource tab of your territory: it lists all the resources produced and currently in the territory's storages. This is also where you can trade,buy,sell ot transport resources between territories later on.

#tuto_32_2
Clic to open the tab.

#tuto_33_1
Each button shows you one type of resource currently stored or produced in the territory. On each button you can see the amount stocked, a sign indicating it's current variation, and it's local price.

#tuto_33_2
Now click on one of these buttons to open it's Resource Menu.

#tuto_34_1
The Resource Menu gives you all the details about a specific resource: production, consumption by population or industries, price...

#tuto_34_c1
Ok.--35--24

#tuto_35_1
It also gives you access to some resource-specific options. 

#tuto_35_2
The first one is the storage policy: you can change the rules for storing this specific resource such as only allowing it in specific storages or forbidding it totally.

#tuto_35_c1
Got it.--38--25

#tuto_35_c2
What happens when there's no room to store things ?--36

#tuto_35_c3
What is the "only in restricted" mode ?--37

#tuto_36_1
If there is no room available, resources will be placed directly on the floor where they will decay and eventually be lost unless quickly stored properly. 

#tuto_36_2
Extra resources on the ground will auto-relocate to any valid storage if free space becomes available.

#tuto_36_c1
Got it.--38--25

#tuto_36_c2
What is the "only in restricted" mode ?--37

#tuto_37_1
When you clic on a storage building, you can set it to "restricted" and control what resources are allowed in it. 

#tuto_37_2
If you then set a resource storage policy to "only in restricted" in this menu, it will ONLY be allowed in storages that are in "restricted" mode AND that have been set to allow that specific resource. If there's no room the resources are destroyed.

#tuto_37_c1
Got it.--38--25

#tuto_37_c2
What happens when there's no room to store things ?--36

#tuto_38_1
The second one is the "Maintain stock" option: it allows you to ensure some of the produced resources will be saved to maintain a certain amount in stock, no matter what. Its really usefull to maintain stocks of foods for instance, regardless of the population's consumption.

#tuto_38_c1
Good to know!--39--26

#tuto_39_1
For now your only storage available is the "Ground storage": a free but inefficient storage of basic resources. It's just ground marked for storage of things. 

#tuto_39_2
Later on you will unlock proper storage buildings that can store much more on a smaller surface.

#tuto_39_c1
Very well.--40

#tuto_40_1
Not all resources can be stored anywhere: some specific categories of resources require specific storage types.

#tuto_40_2
For example, foods like meat or wheat can only be stored in granaries and livestocks require Paddocks. For now though, you do not have access to these buildings.

#tuto_40_c1
Ok.--41--27

#tuto_41_1
Now to the next mission : start producing some Wood.

#tuto_41_2
Wood, like Hammers, is an essential material used for many constructions. It is also consummed by many industrial buildings to craft other products.

#tuto_41_3
Place a woodcutter near a dense area of trees to start producing some.

#tuto_42_1
Excellent. Now it's time to think about defending yourself: for that you will have to create a new "Formation" (a group of units).

#tuto_42_2
There is different types of formations. The best one to start defending yourself with is the "Militia".

#tuto_42_c1
Tell me more.--43

#tuto_43_1
In a "Militia" formation, it's units are not really recruited: it's the current population of the territory itself. Think of it as a stash of weapons kept ready for the population to take arms with when attacked.

#tuto_43_2
Therefore, it's units are not actually removed from your population and are "free", but the Militia cannot move to other territories and is purely defensive. Its perfect as basic defense.

#tuto_43_c1
Where do i create one ?--44--29

#tuto_44_1
This is the Units tab. In it you can see all the formations currently present in the territory. It's also where you can create new Formations.

#tuto_44_2
Clic on the tab to open it.

#tuto_45_1
Now clic the button to create a new Formation. Select the "Militia" type, and place the Formation's camp near your tribe.

#tuto_46_1
Very well. Now you have to recruit your first units into this new formation.

#tuto_46_2
There is different categories of units: civilian units are what you will use to create settling expeditions or transfering goods with carriers, but obviously not to defend youself. Open the "Ranged" tab.

#tuto_47_1
For now you only have access to a single ranged military unit: the rockthrower. A porco simply equiped with stones to throw, best used to defend behind walls and gates.

#tuto_47_2
Now, recruit at least 20 rockthrowers (2 troops of 10 each). Remember: as a "Militia", in fact you're not really recruiting them but merely storing equipment (here simple stones) for your population to use in case of attack.

#tuto_47_c1
What happens if i 'recruit' more militia that i have of population ?--48

#tuto_48_1
Then your militia will not be fully "manned" in case of attack: if you saved up equipment for 40 soldiers as your militia but only have 15 porcos in age to fight at the time of the attack in the territory, your Militia will only include 15 soldiers in the battle.

#tuto_48_c1
Got it.--47

#tuto_49_1
Congratulations: you now saved equipment -a bunch of wooden clubs- for your population to use in case of attack. 

#tuto_49_2
Now, additionnaly to that, you can also organize the defensive strategy of your units using the "Strategic tool", such as defining the deployment positions of your new militia. Clic to open it.

#tuto_50_1
With this tool, you can preview where all your troops ( militia or not ) will deploy in case of battle.

#tuto_50_2
You can select each troop and redeploy it where you want with the right clic. Hold it to set their ranks and orientation.

#tuto_50_c1
Tell me more.--51--35

#tuto_51_1
You can set the behavior mode of each troop. By default they will move to engage any enemy that arrives.

#tuto_51_2
With a troop selected, you can clic the dropdown button on the bottom left to select other modes that will affect that troop's behavior in battle.

#tuto_51_c1
Very well.--52--36

#tuto_52_1
Another tool is to create "Defensive zones" by clicking this button. Then clic and drag on the terrain to set a point and a radius around it. 

#tuto_52_2
Once the zone is created, you can deploy troops in it and set them to the "defensive zone" behavior to have them defend this specific zone: they will be allowed to move out of it during battle.

#tuto_52_c1
Got it.--53--37

#tuto_53_1
Rockthrowers are only usefull in defense behind walls: I advise you to create a small fort of palissades and to then deploy them in it in 'stand ground' mode. This will protect you at least against invasion attempts.

#tuto_53_2
Once you are happy with your changes, make sure to close and SAVE your changes by clicking here.

#tuto_54_1
You now finished organizing your basic defenses. 

#tuto_54_2
In addition to potential events or conflicts with other players, nearby NPC 'barbarian' camps are likely to regularly spawn warbands that will attempt to raid, sack , or even invade your territories. 

#tuto_54_3
It won't be long before they notice you and send their first raiders, so you better be ready!

#tuto_54_c1
Good to know...--55--39

#tuto_55_1
It's time to address the topic of Knowledges (technologies), which unlock things like new buildings or new resources.

#tuto_55_2
To get new knowledges, you need to complete Projects. And to get Projects, you need to get Ideas. 

#tuto_55_c1
Go on...--56

#tuto_56_1
Ideas can come from your own population, spread from other territories, or be directly exchanged with other players via treaties.

#tuto_56_2
You cannot directly control when and what ideas your people will have. Each idea comes with it's own hidden conditions.

#tuto_56_c1
Ok.--57

#tuto_57_1
Now that your tribe is done setting camp in this territory, they got their first idea for Sedentarity, which will allow you to build your first proper dwellings.

#tuto_57_2
To actually get the 'knowledge' of Sendentarity, you will need to complete it's project first.

#tuto_57_c1
How do i do that ?--58--40

#tuto_58_1
This new button allows you to open another important menu : the Government Menu.

#tuto_58_2
That's where you can manage and monitor all global matters (non territory-specific ones) such as your treasury balance, your culture, your policies etc...

#tuto_58_3
Clic to open it.

#tuto_59_1
The "Society" tab is where you manage your Policies, defining how your society is organized and works.

#tuto_59_2
For now, you are a primitive band society with a gift economy where everyone shares their goods. 

#tuto_59_c1
How do i change that ?--60

#tuto_60_1
Later, with new knowledges, you'll unlock new policies allowing your to evolve your society's political and economical organization.

#tuto_60_2
Now open the "Knowledges" tab to access your projects.

#tuto_61_1
This colum shows all the Knowledges your society currently has. It's empty for now.

#tuto_61_2
It also shows your knowledge capacity and current use. Each new knowledge costs some points depending on it's complexity. If your capacity is fully used, you will not be able to master new knowledges.

#tuto_61_c1
Ok.--63--43

#tuto_61_c2
How do i get knowledge capacity ?--62

#tuto_62_1
Your capacity is increased by your total culture. At start, your culture will be mostly produced by your total population so the more population you have, the more knowledge capacity.

#tuto_62_2
Later, with writting,  you'll also be able to build Libraries to manually increased your knowledge capacity.

#tuto_62_c1
Ok.--63--43

#tuto_63_1
The "Sedentary life" project will unlock the knowledge of "Sedentism". To start it you first need to assign "researchers" to the project, and each project requires a specific 'class' of researchers (here it's Farmers).

#tuto_63_2
Clic the "+" button to assign researchers to the project.

#tuto_64_1
Be careful: assigning researchers reduces the productivity of all buildings employing the same population class as they are busy with the project instead of working.

#tuto_64_2
For instance, if you assign ALL your farmers to a project, then your farms will no longer produce anything.

#tuto_64_3
Select how many researchers you want to assign for the project and validate.

#tuto_65_1
Each researcher contributes 'research points' based on their intelligence.

#tuto_65_2
Each project also has a difficulty level, and the average intelligence of the assigned researchers define the odds of successfuly completing the project.

#tuto_65_c1
Ok.--66--46

#tuto_66_1
To start some projects you may also need to pay coins or resources. You will also need enough knowledge space to store the new knowledge it unlocks.

#tuto_66_2
You can now clic to start the work on the project.

#tuto_67_1
Congratulations, you started your first project! It will take some time to complete it, depending on your number of researchers and their efficiency.

#tuto_67_c1
Very well.--111

#tuto_67_c2
What happens if a project fails ?--68

#tuto_68_1
If your project fails, you will have to restart it from scratch again. 

#tuto_68_2
You will have to repay all the starting requirements.

#tuto_68_c1
Damnit... So what now ?--111

#tuto_69_1
You now know all the minimum basics to start ruling and developing your tribe in Ymir and I only have a few things left to show you before i leave you.

#tuto_69_c1
It's about time!--70--48

#tuto_70_1
This is your player score. Its based on different stats like your total wealth, culture, military power and knowledges.

#tuto_70_c1
Ok.--71--49

#tuto_71_1
Next to it are your Victory Points. They are earned by completing victory missions that may be shared in common with other players, in which case only the first one to complete it will get the reward.

#tuto_71_2
You win the game by beeing the first player to reach the objective of Victory Points set for that game.

#tuto_71_c1
Good to know!--72--50

#tuto_71_c2
How do i get these missions ?--81

#tuto_72_1
Well that's it : my work here is now done and it's time for me to leave you in charge.

#tuto_72_c1
Thank you mister Pig.--999

#tuto_72_c2
Wait! What should i do now ?--73

#tuto_72_c3
I have some questions!--74

#tuto_73_1
Now that your tribe is settled, it's population should be slowly growing but this can take some time.

#tuto_73_2
In the meantime, it might be a good idea to keep exploring your surroundings in the worldmap and to locate herds to hunt down to provide your tribe with additional food to boost it's growth.

#tuto_73_c1
Ok.--74

#tuto_74_1
What do you want to know more about, young piglet ?

#tuto_74_c1
I have no more questions, mister Pig.--75

#tuto_74_c2
Can i see you again ?--76

#tuto_75_1
Farewell then, and good luck!

#tuto_75_c1
Goodbye!--999

#tuto_76_1
Yes i might popup from time to time when you unlock new important things!

#tuto_76_c1
Ok!--74

#tuto_77_1
You will have to create a new 'Formation' (your exploration expedition) and recruit units in it, then move it from the worldmap view.

#tuto_77_2
But be careful! This is dangerous, as every time you explore new territory tiles you may trigger 'exploration events': There is a lot to gain from them but also a lot to lose.

#tuto_77_c1
Ok.--78

#tuto_78_1
For your explorers to have any chance of success i strongly suggest you to recruit at least 10 warriors into your expedition party, for the world is dark and full of terrors.

#tuto_78_c1
Very well.--74

#tuto_79_1
Herds are finite groups of animals and not a permanent resource: they cannot be exploited by the Hunter building.

#tuto_79_2
To hunt them, you have to form a hunting party: Create a 'Formation' and recruit hunters (any warriors of your choice) as well as some carriers to transport the looted meat.

#tuto_79_c1
What then ?--80

#tuto_80_1
Move the hunters to the same territory as the herd in the worldmap and give them the order to "Hunt": it will initiate a battle where they will attempt to kill animals of the herd.

#tuto_80_2
Animals will fight back so be careful! Once the hunting is over and if successful, the formation will have fresh meat in it's inventory, which you can bring back to your tribe.

#tuto_80_c1
Excellent.--74

#tuto_81_1
You can't. Victory point missions, like other missions or other events, will happen to you randomly.

#tuto_81_c1
Fair enough.--72--50

#tuto_82_1
Are you sure? This tutorial can help you...

#tuto_82_c1
Yes--83

#tuto_83_1
Are you really sure ? I think it might be the best thing for you.

#tuto_83_c1
Yes!--84

#tuto_84_1
I think i know what is best for you, i'm going to stay here and go on with this tutorial. 

#tuto_84_c1
Please go away...--1

#tuto_84_c2
What can i do to make you leave me alone ?--85

#tuto_85_1
Bears.

#tuto_85_c1
What ?--86

#tuto_86_1
I have bears.

#tuto_86_c1
Bears ? What does that have to do with anything ?--87

#tuto_87_1
It will, if you don't go on with my tutorial.

#tuto_87_c1
You're a Bear summoning tutorial assistant ?--88

#tuto_87_c2
I don't see any bears. Where are they ?--98

#tuto_88_1
Yes.

#tuto_88_c1
And what will your bears do if i don't follow your tutorial ?--89

#tuto_89_1
My bears are trained to do many things, including devouring the entrails of your tribespigs.

#tuto_89_c1
I don't care, i can get another tribe.--90

#tuto_90_1
You're not a really good leader for your people.

#tuto_90_c1
You're not a really good tutorial assistant.--91

#tuto_91_1
You're mean.

#tuto_91_c1
Will you leave me alone now ?--92

#tuto_92_1
Fine. Have fun with this shitty game: Its UIs and menus are so bad you're never gonna figure it out by yourself anyways. I'm too old for this shit...

#tuto_92_c1
Yes, FINE! I don't need you!--999

#tuto_92_c2
Wait what ?--93

#tuto_93_1
No it's too late. Ha! I bet you won't even find how to settle your tribe, the buttons have been visciously hidden... Goodbye... Piglet!

#tuto_93_c1
No! Don't leave, i changed my mind!--94

#tuto_93_c2
I'll take my chances, if it means getting passed this lousy tutorial.--999

#tuto_94_1
That's not gonna be enough. I demand apologies.

#tuto_94_c1
I'm sorry.--95

#tuto_95_1
I'm sorry who ?

#tuto_95_c1
I'm sorry, mister Sagacious Pig.--96

#tuto_96_1
It's MISTER mister Sagacious pig to you.

#tuto_96_c1
I'm sorry, mister mister Sagacious Pig. Can we get back at it now?--97

#tuto_97_1
Hmmmph... That will do, pig... that will do. You better be listening and nice this time!

#tuto_97_c1
I'm listening.--1

#tuto_98_1
They're hiding. Bears hibernate.

#tuto_98_c1
You're bluffing.--99

#tuto_98_c2
We're not even in winter. Bears only hibernate in winter.--104

#tuto_99_1
I have an army of bears! I can summon them all and wipe your insolent tribe off this world!

#tuto_99_c1
No you don't. You're just a lame tutorial assistant trying to be funny.--100

#tuto_100_1
How dare you!

#tuto_100_c1
You don't even exist. You're just a script of pseudo interactive pre-written lines here only for my personnal entertainment.--101

#tuto_101_1
You're lying!

#tuto_101_c1
I can get rid of you anytime by simply editing the .ini file of this game.-102

#tuto_102_1
No you can't! You will be lost in this game without me. You NEED me.

#tuto_102_c1
Yes i can, and i will. Right now.--103--51

#tuto_102_c2
Yes i could. But i'm a generous god. I will let you carry on with your purpose.--1

#tuto_103_1
Not before i spawn my army of Bears and exterminate your puny excuse of a tribe. Die Fetcher!

#tuto_103_c1
How... What kind of freakin' tutorial is this ?!--999

#tuto_104_1
Oh because you're such an expert in bears!

#tuto_104_c1
Yes i am, actually.--105

#tuto_105_1
Fine. If you're such an expert, then answer that: how do you call a group of bears ? If you answer right, i will leave. If you don't, you'll have to endure my tutorial.

#tuto_105_c1
A group of bears.--106

#tuto_105_c2
A band.--107

#tuto_105_c3
A sloth.--108

#tuto_105_c4
A congregation.--107

#tuto_106_1
You are wise, young piglet. Wiser than you look. Fair enough, i will leave you alone. But are you sure you want to skip this tutorial ?

#tuto_106_c1
Yes.--999

#tuto_106_c2
No. I won, but I will indulge your tutorial.--1

#tuto_107_1
Wrong! You foolish piglet! Now pay attention and suffer my neverending tutorial!

#tuto_107_c1
Damnit...--1

#tuto_108_1
You googled it, didn't you.

#tuto_108_c1
No.--109

#tuto_109_1
You did. I know it. Just admit it, or face irreversible consequences!

#tuto_109_2
I am the Bearmaster. If you do not come clean, i will summon my army of vengeful bears and exterminate you and your puny tribe! Then, no more tutorial for you, MISTER piglet! You will be alone in this cruel unforgiving game with it's confusing counter-intuitive UIs and menus. So think again, before doing anything foolish as to defy me. This is your last chance!

#tuto_109_c1
I will not!--110--51

#tuto_110_1
You CHEATED! For this you deserve unBEARable punishment! Its time for my bears to maul your insolent tribe!

#tuto_110_c1
I can't beleive this...--999

#tuto_111_1
Now let's wait until the project is completed...

#tuto_112_1
There! You can now build your first solid dwelling : a primitive rustic hut. 

#tuto_112_2
Currently, your tribe is living in 'slums'. Slums are 1 tile dwellings that will spawn automatically whenever no proper housing is available. They will also disapear automatically when empty houses are available, as it's residents relocate into them.

#tuto_112_c1
What's the use of providing good houses ?--113

#tuto_113_1
Slums provide no bonuses while houses improve the Health and Life Quality of it's residents. Life quality increases Intelligence while Health decreases sickness, which reduces the amount of your porcos dying during each generation. 

#tuto_113_2
Improving both these stats will increase your population's happiness and growth, giving you more Actives to employ in buildings or armies.

#tuto_113_c1
Good to know!--114

#tuto_114_1
Your next assignement is to use your starting resources to start building your first proper huts. Once they are completed, slums will progressively disapear as population relocates into the new houses. 

#tuto_114_2
You can also speed up this process by manually destroying the slums. If you destroy more than there is room available, new ones will simply reappear elsewhere, so you can't lose any population!

#tuto_114_c1
Very well.--115

#tuto_115_1
This is the destroy tool. Its what you use to order the destruction of infrastuctures, clear terrain, or deconstruct building. When you right clic on it, you can filter what you wish to destroy.

#tuto_115_2
When your order the deconstruction of a building, you will recover about half it's initial materials.

#tuto_115_c1
Good!--116

#tuto_116_1
Now complete your current assignement by building at least 10 huts for your population.

#tuto_117_1
Good! As a reward new families settled in your territory which will help us for to the next step: creating your first expedition to hunt and explore.

#tuto_117_c1
Why is that ?--131

#tuto_131_1
As hunters and gatherers, you currently rely only on your natural sources of food which might quickly become insufficient for your tribe. You need to explore territories around your village and to hunt Herds to provide the extra food you'll need to support the growth of your tribe.

#tuto_131_c1
What are Herds ?--118

#tuto_118_1
Herds are groups of animal units. They are finite and are not a permanent resource: they cannot be exploited by the Hunter building. 

#tuto_118_2
As 'units', they are visible from the world map and can be hunted without the need of a settlement.

#tuto_118_c1
How do i hunt them, then ?--119

#tuto_119_1
To hunt them, you have to form an expedition party.

#tuto_119_2
While a militia is just a stack of weapons to use by your population in case of attack, a regular 'army' is a group of actual units that are removed from your population and permanently mobilized. An army can move to other territories and perform actions like hunting.

#tuto_119_c1
Got it, so what do i do ?--120

#tuto_120_1
Now create a new 'Army' formation and recruit 10 warriors in it. 

#tuto_120_2
This time note that they will be removed from your current population as it's not a 'Militia', so you'll never want to recruit all your actives in an army because it would empty all it's production buildings of it's workers.

#tuto_121_1
Select your new formation by clicking on it's camp or by clicking it's button on the Formations tab.

#tuto_122_1
On your selected Formation's menu, click the "+" button to add additionnal troops to your already existing army.

#tuto_123_1
Armies can carry goods and have their own inventory whose capacity depends on the units in it. Carriers are non-fighting units who simply provide a lot of inventory capacity for your Formation.

#tuto_123_2
You need to recruit at least 3 of them.

#tuto_124_1
You can see your formation's inventory by clicking on it's inventory tab in it's menu.

#tuto_124_2
There you can see it's current inventory capacity, and you can load or unload resources from your formation into your territory.

#tuto_124_c1
Got it!--125

#tuto_125_1
Now that your first expedition is ready, go back to the worlmap view to start exploring other territories.

#tuto_126_1
On the worldmap view, all your formations will be visible and you can select them and give them orders. 'Militias' will also appear, but cannot be moved as they are binded to their territory!

#tuto_126_2
You can recruit, disband, load and unload resources directly from the worldmap as well.

#tuto_126_c1
Ok!--127

#tuto_127_1
Now beware! Only the tiles next to your tribe are visible while the rest remains hidden until you first explore it. But whenever you uncover new tiles for the first time, you group of explorers might trigger an "exploration event".

#tuto_127_c1
Got it.--132

#tuto_132_1
These events can be dangerous but can also be rewarding, giving you new resources and units. To have any chance of successfully explore, always do so with a group of 10 or more porcos. Once a territory has been explored once, you can then move safely through them for it will not trigger any new exploration event.

#tuto_132_c1
Good to know!--128

#tuto_128_1
Now try to locate a 'herd': a group of animals units, and explore new tiles if you have to. Select the herd formation once you have found one.

#tuto_129_1
That's a 'herd'. You can see how many animals it has and you can click on it's inventory to see it's 'loot' : the total amound of meat and leather you can recover from killing them.

#tuto_129_2
With your formation of warriors selected, you can right clic on the tile of the territory where the herd is, and the action "Hunt" will be available.

#tuto_129_c1
What happens next ?--130

#tuto_130_1
If you confirm the hunting action, it will initiate a 'battle' between your warriors and the animals of the herd. You can also witness the hunting by going into the territory.

#tuto_130_2
If your warriors are sucessful, some or all of the animals loot will be transfered into your formation's inventory, which you can then bring back and unload into your territory, providing extra food to support your tribe's growth!

#tuto_130_c1
Excellent!--69

#tuto_300_1
Congrats! It looks like you have unlocked the knowledge of agriculture for the first time!

#tuto_300_c1
Indeed.--301

#tuto_300_c2
No, i don't need your help thank you!--998

#tuto_301_1
Agriculture now allows you to create fields with your gathering camps. Fields are not buildings: they are 'annexes'.

#tuto_301_2
An annex is constructed and linked to the building owning it. It provides it with additionnal production sources, distribution, or even bonuses such as increasing its efficiency.

#tuto_301_c1
Very well.--302

#tuto_302_1
Fields are a production annex to your gathering camps. Thanks to them you can now place new gathering camps regardless of the presence of exploitable natural resources, as you can make your own with fields!

#tuto_302_2
To create fields, select one of your gathering camps to open its building menu.

#tuto_303_1
The available annexes for a building appear on the bottom of its building menu. Click on the new Field button to place fields for this gathering camp.

#tuto_304_1
Fields cost hoes to create as well as one resource unit of the culture type (as seeds). Once placed they are permanent and each fields adds a new "production source" to the building they are attached to.

#tuto_304_2
Ground fertility affects the productivity of the fields : try placing them over the most fertile grounds (groundwater is not effective yet).

#tuto_304_c1
Got it!--305

#tuto_305_1
Each field requires workforce from its building to be exploited. If the workforce of the gathering camp is already 100% used, it is useless to add any new fields until some is available. That can happen after upgrading the building or changing policies that affect building's efficiency.

#tuto_305_c1
Good to know.--306

#tuto_306_1
Agriculture also unlocks a new type of tools required to make fields: hoes. To make them, you can click on one of your toolmakers and switch its production from hammers to hoes!

#tuto_306_c1
Ok!--307

#tuto_307_1
That's it for now, enjoy farming!

#tuto_307_c1
Thank you mister Sagacious Pig.--998

#tuto_400_1
It looks like its the first time you ever discover the knowledge of "Barter"! 

#tuto_400_2
This allows you to enable the economic policy of "fair exchange". It's a milestone transition for your society that requires to explain a few new things...

#tuto_400_c1
Go on...--401

#tuto_401_1
By enabling "fair exchange", you will transition from a gift economy to a barter economy where people no longer freely share their commodities with each other while expecting later paybacks.

#tuto_401_c1
So what?--402

#tuto_402_1
Then, people will have properties and trade goods of equivalent value immediately. Your population will have incomes depending on their activites and they will also be able to increase their wealth level beyond 1 as a consequence.

#tuto_402_c1
Ok--403

#tuto_403_1
More importantly, while being in a gift economy your people can automatically access any of the available resources they want but this will no longer be the case once you enable "fair exchange".

#tuto_403_2
For people to access a resource, it will need to be distributed first and they'll have to purchase it.

#tuto_403_c1
How can I do that?--404

#tuto_403_c2
Very well. What then?--405

#tuto_404_1
There is 2 ways of doing this. The first one is with a new building, the merchant, that only does distribution. It will 'consume' one specific resource from the territory's stocks and make it available for the population to buy.

#tuto_404_2
The traders keep a share of the sales incomes while the rest goes to the original producers of the resource.

#tuto_404_c1
What's the other way?--405

#tuto_405_1
All production buildings also have access to a new type of annex: market stands. Like other annexes such as fields for farms, they're available from the production building's menu. 

#tuto_405_2
These annexes consume some of the building's workforce but they make the whole production of the building available for the people to buy. 

#tuto_405_c1
So what's the difference between the 2 methods?--406

#tuto_406_1
Market stands are free, consume workforce, and cannot distribute resource from stocks. They only sell their building's current productions.

#tuto_406_2
Merchants will sell any available resource -produced or stored- but they require one worker and they are not free to build. Also, they keep a share of all sales for themselves reducing the income of the producers.

#tuto_406_c1
Very well. What now?--407

#tuto_407_1
Once "fair exchange" is enabled, your population no longer has any access to any resource -including food- that is not 'distributed' by merchants or market stands. 

#tuto_407_2
It will be urgent that you start by making food (and then other resources such as pottery etc..) available to your people again by building merchants or setting up market stands with your production buildings.

#tuto_407_c1
Ok!--408

#tuto_407_c2
Wait... How can I do that again?--404

#tuto_408_1
Now, thanks to barter, your workers will now be much more efficient and your society more stable with less conflict allowing you to manage a bigger community with less risks of instability. 

#tuto_408_2
You'll also get to control if and how much you want to distribute each produced resource depending on your needs, which you can't do in a gift economy!

#tuto_408_c1
Good to know.--409

#tuto_409_1
Fair exchange enabling a primitive form of currency, you'll now also have to manage your government's treasury balance which is in charge of all the services global to the community such as the maintenance of common buildings, the village's palissades, or armies. These services require payments as well once you're not in a gift economy!

#tuto_409_c1
How do I fund all that?--410

#tuto_410_1
In these primitive times, the biggest source of income you can get is from your leader's own personnal funds by making them one and the same. 

#tuto_410_2
Using the "privileges" policy you can define the % of the territory's wealth awarded to your leader by right. This will slowly increase his personal wealth level which you can monitor in the territory menu by selecting the "Leader" population class.

#tuto_410_c1
Ok...--411

#tuto_411_1
Then, with the "Leadership" policy, you can assign how much of his personnal wealth you wish to assign to the government's expenses! 

#tuto_411_2
For example, a leader with a wealth of 20 contributing at 50% will therefore generate a treasury income of +10.

#tuto_411_c1
How else can I generate treasury income?--412

#tuto_412_1
This is likely to be your main source of income in these early ages. Besides that, your people will also willingly contribute to expenses for the community with up to 20% of their own incomes but its likely to remain marginal at first.

#tuto_412_2
Once you develop proper taxation, you'll be able to modify this percentage yourself!

#tuto_412_c1
Very well.--413

#tuto_413_1
That is all for now. Good luck in this difficult transition!

#tuto_413_c1
Thank you mister Sagacious Pig.--997
