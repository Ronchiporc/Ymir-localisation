Creating a first settlement

#msn1_1
Greetings, [x].

#msn1_2
After living as nomads since the dawn of times, living of hunting and gathering, your primitive tribe has finally stumbled upon a territory that seemed worthy of renouncing their nomadic ways. The time has come to settle down and build something significant to resist the test of time, and they have chosen you to lead them.

#msn1_3
This seems to be a decent territory to do so, but maybe it's worth continuing your journey to find better lands ( not adviced for new players ), the decision is yours.

#msn1_o_1
Settle your tribe in a territory

#msn1_o_2
Select your tribe formation in the world map, clic on the 'orders' button in its menu (bottom-left) and then select the order 'settle' to create a new settlement.

#msn2
Water for the tribe

#msn2_1
Our newly settled tribe now urgently needs fresh water to survive!

#msn2_2
We have to arrange for a spot where the people of the tribe can easily access and get fresh water. No need to worry about it: the people of the tribe will use it by themselves to get the water they need.

#msn2_3
We'll have to watch out though: while one is enough for our small tribe for now, these spots can only accomodate a limited amount of people until new ones are required!

#msn2_o_1
Build a water collector on the shore of any source of fresh water.

#msn2_o_2
In the building tabs, select the water collector and find a valid spot to place it on the shore of fresh water tiles. This building does not require anything and will automatically produce and distribute some water to the population, satisfying their vital need for water.

#msn3
Hunting

#msn3_1
Our newly settled tribe will quickly starve if we do not find food.

#msn3_2
We need to build a hunting camp near any available source of wild animals we can find in our new territory. This will provide us with fresh meat but also leather.

#msn3_o_1
Build a hunting camp to hunt naturally present wild animals and produce meat.

#msn3_o_2
Go in your newly settled territory. In the building tabs, select the hunting camp and scan the terrain. The highlighted area around the building is its range. Exploitable tiles show up in green. Look for animals and place the hunting camp in range so that it will produce meat.

#msn4
Gathering

#msn4_1
It seems there is also plants in the territory that produce vegetables and fruits we can harvest to feed the tribe.

#msn4_2
We need to build a gathering camp near any available source of wild edible plants we can find in our new territory. 

#msn4_o_1
Build a gathering camp to exploit edible plants and produce more food.

#msn4_o_2
In your newly settled territory, in the building tabs, select the gathering camp and scan the terrain. The highlighted area around the building is its range. Exploitable tiles show up in green. Look for edible plants and place the gathering camp in range so that it will harvest them and produce food.

#msn5
Tools

#msn5_1
We were only carrying a few stone stools with us. Those are required for pretty much everything and soon we will need new ones if we want to keep developping the tribe! 

#msn5_2
We should assign a few porcos to the lenghly task of collecting flints from the gravely grounds around here while others can skillfuly use the flints to craft new stone tools.

#msn5_o_1
Build a tool maker and a flint collector to start a production of Hammers.

#msn5_o_2
Hammers are the first type of tools. Unlike foods, the population itself doesnt consume or need it, but they are required to build many things.

#msn6
Wood

#msn6_1
We will also need wood to make things. 

#msn6_2
We should assign a few porcos to the task of collecting wood from the trees around us : we'll need it!

#msn6_o_1
Build a wood gatherer near trees to start a production of Wood.

#msn6_o_2
Wood, like Hammers, is not a resource consummed directly by population. But it is required for many constructions and as a material for some production buildings as well.

#msn7
Defending the tribe

#msn7_1
There might be hostile barbarians around and other unfriendly tribes. We need to be ready to defend ourselves!

#msn7_2
Rockthrowers are porcos simply armed with big rocks to throw at the enemy. They are the earliest range unit available. They are slow and have a really short range, making them pretty useless for anything else but defending behind walls and gates. 

#msn7_3
We should create a small wooden fort and then recruit a militia of rockthrowers. Deploy them inside the fort in 'stand ground' mode using the 'strategic tool'. This way they will remain in it during battles and won't try to move to engage the enemy. If enemy warriors attack and try to breach the fort, the rockthrowers will be able to attack them from the other side giving you a defensive advantage. You can also add warriors in case the attackers manage to breach through as the rockthrowers will be bad in melee.

#msn7_o_1
Create a militia to defend the tribe.

#msn7_o_2
Go to the military tab of your territory and create a new formation of the 'militia' type. Place their campment and recruit 'rockthrowers' into it. Use the strategic tool de deploy them and set their behavior to "stand ground", ideally inside a small fort of wooden palissades.

#msn8
New ideas and knowledges

#msn8_1
Occasionally, Porcos of our tribe will get new ideas about how to improve our society and techniques. Ideas from other tribes might reach us as well. These ideas unlock 'projects' we can complete to unlock and master new knowledges. 

#msn8_2
While we cannot directly control the appearance of new ideas - though high population's quality of life and intelligence will favor it - we can choose to invest or not in the projects unlocked by them. To be started, projects require to have researchers assigned to them, and might also require things like resources or money. Depending on the amount and intelligence of the researchers and the required work, the project will take some time to be completed. If it's sucessfuly completed it will unlock its rewards, usually including a new knowledge.

#msn8_3
Knowledges enable new buildings, policies and resources and allow your society to evolve. They require a certain amount of 'knowledge space' - the ability of your society to keep knowledges - which at first you will get only through culture: for each 10 points of culture you get 1 point of knowledge space. In early game, the best way to increase your culture is simply to increase your total population.

#msn8_4
Our tribe just had one of its first ideas: settling down and becoming sedentary. Let's turn this idea into practice by completing its project!

#msn8_o_1
Complete your first project to unlock the knowledge of Sedentism.

#msn8_o_2
In the government tab (crown button on the top left of the screen), go to the knowledges tab and select the Sedentism project. Assign researchers to it and start it and wait until its competed.

#msn_houses
Build your first houses

#msn_houses_1
Now that we have Sedentarity, we can build our first permanent dwellings : primitive rustic huts.

#msn_houses_2
Proper housing provides bonuses of life quality and health to the households residing in it, which will help increase our total population by reducing sickness and increasing their will to have piglets. Once empty housing is available, the population will automatically abandon the makeshift tents they currently reside in to move in their new dwellings. But if the population grows bigger and that not enough houses are available, the extra families will be forced to move into makeshift dwellings again, and Slums will spawn around your city until you resolve the issue. Slums provide no life quality and lowers the health of its residents, reducing your population's growth.

#msn_houses_o_1
Building your first houses

#msn_houses_o_2
In the building tab, select the rustic house building and place at least 10 of them.

#msn_frstform
First explorers

#msn_frstform_1
Now that our population is growing, we should think about forming a group to go explore our surroundings. For this we should gather a group of at least 10 warriors of the tribe and get them ready to move out of the village!

#msn_frstform_2
Unlike the 'militia', troops recruited in a regular army are actually removed from your population and become permanent members of the formation. If disbanded, they will return to the territory's population. Unlike the militia, an army can move to other territories, explore the map and perform actions like attacks, hunting, or carrying resources in its inventory. 

#msn_frstform_3
Each formation has a 'home' territory which is by default the place where it was created. The home territory is the territory that 'supports' the formation representing the fact its units will need to be replaced as they grow old and that time passes. Each territory can support for free a certain amount of troops before having its demography negatively impacted, and you can check this value in the Territory Menu.

#msn_frstform_o_1
Create your first army

#msn_frstform_o_2
Create a new formation of the 'army' type. Place their campment and recruit at least 10 warriors in it.
